                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 3rd, you are a Sagittarius whose life is defined by <strong>abundance,
                            expression, and joy</strong>. You inhabit the first decante of the sign, which is the most
                        potent and "Jupiterian" of all. However, you are also heavily influenced by the <strong>Number
                            3</strong>, which is the numerological equivalent of Jupiter itself. This makes you "Jupiter
                        Squared." Your life is an exercise in scale; you don't just want to participate in life; you
                        want to experience its fullest, richest, and most meaningful expressions.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Master Communicator." While other Sagittarians might be content with their own
                        private philosophies, you have a deep-seated need to share yours. You possess a natural charisma
                        that draws people into your orbit, eager to hear your insights. You are likely the person who
                        can turn a simple observation into a life-changing epiphany for someone else. Your primary drive
                        is to bridge the gap between the mundane and the magnificent through the power of your voice and
                        vision.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary (and secondary) ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, the planet of expansion, luck,
                        higher education, and philosophy. Jupiter is the "Greater Benefic," and its double influence on
                        your birth date gives you an almost magical ability to attract opportunities and resources. You
                        are naturally optimistic, even in the face of disaster, because you truly believe that the
                        universe is a friendly place. You have a "Midas touch" when it comes to ideas; you can see the
                        potential for growth in projects that others have given up on.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is at its most expressive. This is the fire of the
                        <strong>sunlit forge</strong>—creative, purposeful, and radiant. The Number 3 influence brings
                        in the vibrations of the planet Mercury as well (in its role as the communicator), giving your
                        fiery nature a sharp, multi-faceted intellect. You aren't just passionate; you are articulate,
                        funny, and profoundly observant. You are here to learn that your words are your most powerful
                        tool for manifestation.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are almost always seen as confident, high-spirited, and engaging. You have a
                        natural sense of "performance" and can command the attention of a room without even trying. You
                        are likely a natural entertainer, gifted with a sharp wit and a sense of timing. People find you
                        "lucky," but your luck is actually a result of your openness to experience and your refusal to
                        accept "no" as an answer.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to exaggeration and hyperbole</strong>. You love a good
                        story, and you won't let the facts get in the way of a great moral or a loud laugh. This isn't
                        dishonesty; it's your way of emphasizing the "big picture." You have little patience for
                        pedantry or small-mindedness. You are the "broad-brush" painter of the zodiac, and you prefer to
                        leave the fine details to someone else.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>In love, you are a fiery and generous partner. You seek someone who is as intellectually alive as
                        you are. A "stagnant" relationship is your greatest fear. You need a partner who will grow with
                        you, travel with you, and challenge you. You are incredibly loyal as long as the connection
                        feels "expansive." If a relationship begins to feel like a cage, you will eventually find a way
                        to break free.</p>

                    <p>You are an <strong>Idealist in Love</strong>. You tend to fall for people's "potential" rather
                        than who they actually are. This can lead to disappointment, but it also makes you a powerful
                        catalyst for your partner's growth. You are best suited for Fellow Fire signs (Aries, Leo) who
                        can match your energy, or Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) who speak your mental language.
                        You might find Earth signs a bit too grounding, and Water signs a bit too emotionally intense
                        for your high-frequency spirit.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You are a natural for any career that involves <strong>the public, education, media, or
                            international affairs</strong>. You make an excellent professor, broadcaster, politician,
                        entrepreneur, or spiritual guide. You have a talent for sales because you genuinely believe in
                        the potential of what you are selling. You are a natural leader, but you prefer to lead through
                        inspiration rather than direct control.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are a "high-risk, high-reward" individual. You have a natural talent for making
                        money, but your "spending" is just as expansive as your income. You value quality and
                        experiences, and you are unlikely to save for a "rainy day" because you don't believe the rain
                        will ever last that long. Your challenge is to hire a good accountant (likely a Capricorn or a
                        Virgo) who can manage the details while you focus on the vision.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your vitality is your greatest asset. You have an incredible amount of energy, but you are prone
                        to <strong>nervous exhaustion</strong> from doing too much at once. You tend to burn the candle
                        at both ends. Sagittarius rules the hips, thighs, and liver. You need regular, vigorous exercise
                        to burn off your excess fire. Walking, trekking, or any activity that involves "the long haul"
                        is beneficial for you.</p>

                    <p>You also need to be mindful of your liver health, especially since you enjoy the "finer things"
                        of life. "Expansion" is your keyword, but that can also apply to your waistline if you aren't
                        careful. Drinking plenty of water and getting regular sleep (which is often difficult for your
                        active mind) are essential health practices.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>lack of focus</strong>. Because you can do anything and see
                        everything, you may end up doing nothing of substance. You can be the "jack of all trades but
                        master of none." Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Concentration</strong>. Picking one
                        mountain to climb and seeing it through to the summit is the key to your true spiritual success.
                    </p>

                    <p>You also need to learn the difference between "knowledge" and "wisdom." Knowledge is having the
                        facts; wisdom is knowing how to apply them with heart and humility. When you stop trying to
                        convince people you are right and start helping them find their own truth, you fulfill your
                        highest potential.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The December 3rd person is the <strong>Oracle of the Collective</strong>. You are the one who
                        speaks the truth that everyone else is feeling but cannot articulate. You are here to
                        <strong>Inspire and Expand</strong>. Your higher purpose is to provide hope, humor, and vision
                        in a world that often feels small and dark. When you use your powerful voice to serve the common
                        good, you are truly a force for miracles.</p>

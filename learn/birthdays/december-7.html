                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 7th, you are a Sagittarius whose journey is as much <strong>internal as
                            external</strong>. You inhabit the second decante of Sagittarius, ruled by
                        <strong>Mars</strong> and the sign of Aries, which provides you with a powerful individualistic
                        drive. However, the influence of the <strong>Number 7</strong>—the number of Neptune and the
                        sign of Pisces—is the defining feature of your personality. You are a "Mystic Fire-Sign." While
                        other Sagittarians are racing toward a physical horizon, you are often exploring the ocean of
                        the collective unconscious.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Unconventional Seeker." You possess a restless curiosity that isn't satisfied with
                        textbook answers. You have a natural "BS detector" and a deep-seated need to find your own truth
                        through direct personal experience—especially spiritual or metaphysical experience. You are
                        often the "black sheep" of your family or social circle, not because you try to be, but because
                        you simply don't see the world in the same linear way that they do. You are here to bridge the
                        gap between <strong>logic and magic</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, which provides your core drive for freedom and
                        expansion. However, the secondary influence of <strong>Neptune</strong> (vibrated through the
                        number 7) and <strong>Mars</strong> (through the second decante) creates a truly unique alchemy.
                        Neptune makes you intuitive, poetic, and perhaps a bit detached, while Mars makes you courageous
                        and prone to impulsive action. You are a "Dreamer who Acts"—someone who can have a high-level
                        spiritual vision and then immediately try to manifest it in the physical world.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is in a "steam" state—saturated with the watery influence of
                        Neptune. This is the fire of the <strong>alchemical vessel</strong>. You are prone to sudden,
                        deep transformations. Your life is likely characterized by "cycles" where you completely shed an
                        old identity and emerge as someone entirely new. You are here to learn that your
                        <strong>intuition is your primary compass</strong>, and when you ignore it in favor of logic,
                        you lose your way.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as enigmatic, intellectual, and slightly aloof. You have a very
                        "focused" gaze that makes people feel like you are looking right through their social masks and
                        into their souls. You don't enjoy small talk and will often retreat into silence if a
                        conversation feels shallow or boring. You are a natural-born researcher, often possessing a vast
                        store of knowledge on obscure or unconventional subjects.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>surprisingly stubborn and rebellious</strong>. If someone tries
                        to force you into a traditional box, you will fight back with unexpected Mars-driven ferocity.
                        You value your "strangeness" and view it as your most precious asset. Your persona is that of
                        the "Loner on a Mission"—someone who doesn't need external validation to know that they are on
                        the right path.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a December 7th person is a spiritual contract. You are not interested in the "social
                        game" of dating. You seek a "Twin Flame" or a deep soul connection. You need a partner who can
                        handle your need for intense solitude as well as your need for intense conversation. You are
                        incredibly loyal, but you can also be <strong>emotionally demanding</strong> in your need for
                        total authenticity. You cannot tolerate a partner who is defensive or unwilling to look at their
                        own shadows.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are a powerful catalyst for your partner's growth. You will push them to
                        be their best self, often without even trying. You are best suited for fellow Fire signs (Aries,
                        Leo) who can match your intensity, or Water signs (Scorpio, Pisces) who share your depth and
                        intuition. Earth signs may find you too "airy" or impractical, while Air signs might struggle
                        with your deep emotional and spiritual requirements.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that allow for <strong>independent research, spiritual leadership, or
                            creative innovation</strong>. Many born on this day become psychologists, metaphysical
                        teachers, tech innovators, documentary filmmakers, or detectives. You are excellent at finding
                        "hidden gems"—whether that's a hidden truth in a scientific dataset or a hidden talent in a
                        person. You are best when you are working on the "fringe" of your industry.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you have an "unconventional" relationship with money. You value it only to the
                        degree that it buys you the freedom to follow your interests. You may experience sudden
                        "Neptunian" shifts in your income—making a fortune from a stroke of genius and then losing
                        interest in the pursuit of wealth altogether. Your challenge is to develop a bit more grounding
                        so that your brilliant ideas have the physical resources they need to thrive over the long term.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>psychic and emotional boundaries</strong>. Because
                        you are so intuitive, you literally "absorb" the energy of the people and places around you. If
                        you are in a toxic environment, you will develop unexplained health issues—often skin rashes,
                        allergies, or chronic fatigue. You need to learn the art of <strong>psychic
                            hygiene</strong>—regularly "clearing" your energy through salt baths, meditation, and time
                        in nature. Water is your most powerful ally.</p>

                    <p>Physically, you should watch your nervous system and your feet (ruled by Neptune/Pisces).
                        Regular, gentle movement like Tai Chi or walking by the water will ground your "steam-like"
                        fire. You should also be careful with intoxicants, as your system is more sensitive than most
                        and you can easily become "lost in the fog."</p>

                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>escapism and spiritual arrogance</strong>. When the world gets
                        too harsh, you may be tempted to retreat into your own mind or into unhealthy habits to avoid
                        reality. You may also look down on those who don't "see" things as deeply as you do. Your karmic
                        lesson is to learn <strong>Compassion and Grounding</strong>. Realizing that the "unseen world"
                        is only half of the story, and that you are here to integrate it with the "seen world," is your
                        key to fulfillment.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>it is okay to be understood</strong>. You often hide your
                        brilliance because you fear rejection. When you find the courage to share your unconventional
                        visions with the world, you become a powerful force for change.</p>

                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The December 7th person is the <strong>Visionary Detective of the Soul</strong>. You are the one
                        who finds the patterns that no one else sees. You are here to <strong>Awaken the
                            Collective</strong>—to remind us that there is always more to the story than what meets the
                        eye. Your higher purpose is to provide a bridge between the material and the spiritual. When you
                        use your fierce individualist spirit to serve a higher truth, you are a truly enlightened
                        maverick.</p>

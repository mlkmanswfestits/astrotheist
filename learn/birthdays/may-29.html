                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on May 29th, you are a Gemini whose life is defined by <strong>originality, intuition, and a
                            drive for total social and spiritual integration</strong>. You inhabit the <strong>first
                            decante</strong> of Gemini, ruled entirely by <strong>Mercury</strong>. This gives you a
                        high-frequency mental energy, a thirst for variety, and an unshakeable need for communication.
                        However, the influence of the <strong>Master Number 11</strong> (vibrated through the 29:
                        2+9=11) introduces a layer of deep intuitive capacity and a thirst for truth that is rare for
                        your sign. You are the "Philosophical Architect of the Air." While other Geminis might enjoy the
                        surface of the conversation, you are the one who digs deep to understand the <strong>unseen
                            foundation of the mental world</strong>.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Visionary Individualist." You possess a highly concentrated mind and a refusal to
                        follow the crowd. You have a "messenger-master" dynamic: you respect the laws of reality, but
                        you want to be the one who discovers the secret way to apply them. You aren't interested in the
                        easy path; you are here to experience the <strong>triumph of your intellect over
                            mystery</strong>. You have a natural sense of "revelation," but your revelations often come
                        during periods of intense study or mental solitude. You are here to learn that <strong>knowledge
                            is the highest form of spiritual security</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Mercury</strong>, the planet of communication, commerce, and the
                        mind. This gives you your trademark wit and your ability to see patterns where others see chaos.
                        However, the secondary influence of the <strong>Moon and Neptune</strong> (vibrated through the
                        intuitive 11/2/29) creates a truly complex and high-voltage alchemical mix. Mercury brings the
                        intellectual speed, while the Moon adds the sensitivity, and Neptune adds the visionary depth.
                        You are a "Radiant Architect of Thought"—someone who can command with both logical precision and
                        deep, wordless wisdom. You have a "truth-seeking" mind that values the heart's wisdom as much as
                        the brain's logic.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Air</strong>, is in its most concentrated and "reflective" state. This
                        isn't just a breeze; it is <strong>the clear air of a high mountain peak or the silent
                            atmosphere of a library</strong>—focused, purposeful, and capable of transmitting
                        high-frequency information. You have a steady mental energy that demands the study of
                        philosophy, science, or the mystical arts. You are here to learn that your <strong>intellectual
                            labor is a form of deep meditation on the human condition</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as authoritative, professional, and deeply reliable. You have a
                        "presence" that makes people respect your boundaries instinctively. You don't enjoy trivialities
                        and will often find yourself in the role of the "leader," the "strategist," or the "provider."
                        You have a natural sense of "timing"—you know exactly when to act and when to wait for the world
                        to catch up to your vision. You are likely a person of profound integrity; if you give your
                        word, you will move heaven and earth to keep it. People find you "enigmatic," but your mystery
                        is actually a reflection of your intense focus and your need for privacy.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to extreme bouts of social fatigue and a "mountain"
                            complex</strong>. Because you think so much and take in so much data, you may suddenly
                        withdraw to your "base camp." You are the "Individual" who expects the world to respect your
                        need for space. Your persona is that of the "Noble Guardian"—someone who is in the world of
                        power but whose heart is set on a higher truth.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a May 29th person is a search for a "Soul-Companion." You are not interested in the
                        "social game" of dating. You seek a "Conscious Partnership"—someone who can handle your need for
                        intensity and who respects your intellectual independence. You need a partner who is your equal
                        in depth and visionary capacity. You are incredibly loyal as long as the connection remains
                        <strong>mentally and spiritually stimulating</strong>. If a relationship begins to feel routine
                        or superficial, you will eventually find a way to shift the energy or move toward a higher
                        truth.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the source of wisdom and the architect of shared evolution. However,
                        you can be <strong>emotionally demanding in your need for total transparency</strong>. You
                        cannot tolerate a partner who is defensive or who tries to hide their true self. You are best
                        suited for fellow Air signs (Libra, Aquarius) who share your mental drive, or Water signs
                        (Scorpio, Pisces) who share your depth and emotional intensity. Fire signs might provide the
                        spark you love, but they may find your need for structure "too heavy," while Earth signs might
                        provide the stability you need but feel your detachment is overwhelming.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>research, education, strategic planning, or the
                            innovative arts</strong>. Many born on this day become high-profile writers, influential
                        psychologists, successful entrepreneurs in tech, or visionary designers. You are a natural at
                        spotting the "hidden flaw" in any system. You are best when you are in a position where you can
                        work with a high degree of autonomy or when you are the "authority" who provides the visionary
                        direction based on deep study.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to experience success through <strong>originality and smart, diverse
                            planning</strong>. You aren't a traditional gambler; you are an investor in "potential." You
                        view money as <strong>freedom and a tool for further exploration and security</strong>. You are
                        the one who will naturally invest in books, specialized knowledge, and high-quality assets. Your
                        challenge is to ensure that your "idealism" doesn't lead to a total neglect of material
                        stability. You are most successful when your "work" allows for constant learning and the
                        opportunity to share your unique findings.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>mental state and your sense of privacy</strong>.
                        Because you think so much and take in so much data, you are prone to "Mercury burnout"—physical
                        exhaustion that manifests as throat issues, joint sensitivity, or chronic fatigue. You need to
                        learn the art of <strong>intentional grounding</strong>. Gemini rules the lungs and the nervous
                        system. You need regular, steady physical activity that feels like "meditation in motion"—think
                        long-distance walking, yoga, or rhythmic cycling.</p>

                    <p>Mentally, you can suffer from <strong>"isolation fatigue."</strong> If you spend too much time in
                        your own head, you can become prone to melancholia or cynicism. Learning the art of
                        <strong>social connection</strong>—without losing your individuality—is your most powerful
                        health practice. You are here to learn that <strong>the body is the anchor for the brilliant
                            mind</strong>. Regular "digital detoxes" and time in pure nature are essential.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>aloofness and a refusal to "engage with the mundane."</strong>
                        Because you value depth so much, you may skip over the necessary details of daily life or
                        disconnect from the needs of others. You may also struggle with a "secret pride," believing that
                        your information is the only thing that matters. Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Service
                            and Human Connection</strong>. Realizing that the greatest truths are often found in the
                        small, "ordinary" acts of kindness, and that your power is most effective when it is shared, is
                        your key to joy.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>it is okay to be "one of many."</strong> You often feel
                        that you must be the "special" or "different" person in the room. Finding peace in your common
                        humanity is where your true spiritual growth happens. When you find your internal silence, you
                        realize that you are never truly alone.</p>

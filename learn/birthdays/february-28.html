                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on February 28th, you are a Pisces whose life is defined by <strong>originality, leadership,
                            and a drive for spiritual autonomy</strong>. You inhabit the <strong>first decante</strong>
                        of Pisces, ruled by <strong>Neptune (and traditional Jupiter)</strong>. This gives you
                        high-level intuition and a connection to the collective unconscious. However, the influence of
                        the <strong>Number 28</strong> (which reduces to the pioneering <strong>Number 1</strong>)—the
                        number of the initiator, the individual, and the Sun-vibrated leader—adds a surprising layer of
                        strength and ego-definition that is rare in the sign of Pisces. You are the "Warrior Mystic."
                        While other Pisceans might drift with the current, you are the one who swims upstream to find
                        the source.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Soulful Commander." You possess a highly receptive mind but also a refusal to be
                        swallowed by the group. You have a "leader-dreamer" dynamic: you feel the emotional currents
                        (Pisces), but you have the drive to stand apart and direct them (Number 1). You aren't
                        interested in being a follower; you are interested in the path that leads to
                        <strong>self-realization and unique expression</strong>. You have a natural sense of "destiny,"
                        often feeling that you were born to start something new. You are here to learn that
                        <strong>gentleness is a form of strength</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Neptune</strong>, the planet of dreams, illusion, and higher love.
                        This gives you your trademark empathy and artistic talent. However, the influence of the
                        <strong>Sun</strong> (vibrated through the number 1 resonance) creates a truly vibrant and
                        powerful alchemical mix. Neptune brings the vision, while the Sun brings the vitality, the will,
                        and the confidence to shine. You are a "Radiant Light"—someone who glows with an inner
                        conviction. You have a "truth-living" will that wants to embody your ideals.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Water</strong>, is in its most sparkling and "sun-dappled" state. This
                        isn't the dark ocean depths; it is <strong>the surface where the light meets the
                            water</strong>—brilliant, life-giving, and visible to all. You have a steady emotional
                        energy that is confident and optimistic. You are here to learn that <strong>you are allowed to
                            shine</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as charismatic, independent, and surprisingly bold. You have a
                        "presence" that draws attention without you asking for it. You don't enjoy being told what to do
                        and will often chart your own course even if it defies logic. You have a natural sense of
                        "adventure"—you approach life as a quest. You are likely a person of hidden strength; people
                        often underestimate your resolve because of your gentle exterior. People find you "magnetic,"
                        and they naturally follow your lead because you seem to know where you are going.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to stubbornness and a "Lone Wolf" complex</strong>.
                        Because you trust your own intuition above all else, you may ignore good advice. You are the
                        "Prince/Princess" who expects the world to bend to your dream. Your persona is that of the
                        "Hero"—someone who fights for the dream against all odds.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a February 28th person is a search for a "Passionate Union." You are not interested in a
                        partner who dims your light. You seek a "Royal Consort"—someone who celebrates your uniqueness
                        and supports your ambitions. You are incredibly romantic and generous, often treating your
                        partner like royalty. You need a partner who is confident, independent, and emotionally
                        available.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the source of energy and the spark of inspiration. However, you can be
                        <strong>emotionally demanding in your need for admiration and loyalty</strong>. You cannot
                        tolerate a partner who is critical or unsupportive. You are best suited for Fire signs (Leo,
                        Aries, Sagittarius) who match your passion, or Water signs (Scorpio, Cancer) who can provide the
                        emotional depth you crave. Earth signs might act as a stabilizing force but could feel too
                        boring, while Air signs might be too detached.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>leadership, entrepreneurship, the arts, or
                            innovation</strong>. Many born on this day become directors, founders, inventors, or solo
                        artists. You are a natural at "starting something new." You are best when you are your own boss
                        or at least have a high degree of autonomy.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to be successful because you have the courage to take risks. You view
                        money as <strong>energy to fuel your dreams</strong>. You are the one who will naturally invest
                        in your own ideas and projects. Your challenge is to ensure that your optimism doesn't lead to
                        recklessness. You are most successful when your "work" is a unique expression of your soul.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>confidence and your heart</strong>. If you feel
                        stifled or unappreciated, you can suffer from heart palpitations or low energy. You need to
                        learn the art of <strong>self-expression</strong>. Performing, speaking, or leading a group is
                        essential for you.</p>

                    <p>Physically, you should avoid stagnation. Vigorous, fun physical activity like dance, competitive
                        sports, or aerobics is the best way to keep your fire burning. You are here to learn that
                        <strong>vitality is your birthright</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>arrogance and a fear of being ordinary.</strong> You may act
                        grand or aloof to hide your insecurities. You may also struggle with impatience. Your karmic
                        lesson is to learn <strong>Cooperation and Humility</strong>. Realizing that even the greatest
                        leader needs a team, and that every role is important, is your key to true greatness.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>being vulnerable is not being weak.</strong> You often
                        try to hide your tears. Finding the courage to show your soft side allows people to love the
                        real you.</p>

                    <p>The February 28th person is the <strong>Pioneer of the Spirit</strong>. You are the one who
                        charts the new territory of the heart. You are here to <strong>lead with love</strong>. Your
                        higher purpose is to show that strength and compassion can coexist—to show what happens when a
                        warrior lays down their sword to pick up a paintbrush. When you lead from your heart, you create
                        a new world.</p>

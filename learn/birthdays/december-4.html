                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 4th, you are a Sagittarius who understands the value of <strong>structure and
                            mastery</strong>. You inhabit the first decante of Sagittarius, which is ruled by
                        <strong>Jupiter</strong>, granting you the sign's trademark luck and expansive vision. However,
                        the influence of the <strong>Number 4</strong> (ruled by Saturn and Uranus in various systems)
                        brings in the energy of the square—the foundation. While other Sagittarians are content to let
                        their arrows fly and see where they land, you want to build the archway through which those
                        arrows fly.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Architect of Truth." You possess the rare ability to take "high-concept" Sagittarian
                        ideals—like freedom, justice, and spiritual law—and turn them into tangible, functional systems.
                        You are not interested in change that is merely cosmetic; you want to work on the root of the
                        issue. This makes you a formidable force in any environment. You have the heart of a rebel but
                        the hands of a builder.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, the planet of expansion and higher learning. This
                        gives you your love of travel and your need for philosophical depth. However, the
                        <strong>Saturnian</strong> vibration of the number 4 adds a "checking" influence to Jupiter's
                        growth. Saturn asks: "Is it practical? Is it durable? Does it have integrity?" This internal
                        dialogue makes you much more serious and focused than the average Archer.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is dampened by the "earthy" vibration of the number 4. This
                        is the fire of the <strong>foundry</strong>—it is used to melt metal and create tools. Your
                        passion is channeled into your work and your purpose. You are unlikely to waste your energy on
                        frivolous pursuits. You are here to learn that <strong>discipline is the bridge between goals
                            and accomplishment</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as dependable, focused, and authoritative. You carry yourself with
                        a certain dignity that commands respect. People often turn to you when they need a difficult job
                        done right. You aren't necessarily the person who talks the most, but you are the person whose
                        words carry the most weight. You have little patience for incompetence or lazy thinking.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to extreme bouts of seriousness</strong>. You take your
                        responsibilities so personally that you may find it difficult to "let go" and simply enjoy the
                        moment. You are the "Responsible Spirit" who worries about the outcome while others are just
                        enjoying the ride. Your dry, often sarcastic sense of humor is your primary release valve for
                        this internal pressure.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a December 4th person is a serious commitment. You are not interested in shallow flings
                        or emotional drama. You seek a partner who has their own ambitions and who respects your need
                        for space and focused work. You are incredibly loyal, but you express your love through
                        <strong>acts of service and long-term planning</strong> rather than grand romantic gestures.</p>

                    <p>Unexpectedly, once you do open up, you are deeply passionate. You need a partner who can help you
                        loosen up and experience the lighter side of life. You are most compatible with Fellow Fire
                        signs (Aries, Leo) who appreciate your strength, or Earth signs (Capricorn, Virgo, Taurus) who
                        share your practical approach to life. Air signs might find you too rigid, while Water signs
                        might struggle with your logical approach to emotional issues.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You are a natural for careers that require <strong>vision, stamina, and attention to
                            detail</strong>. You excel in engineering, law, architecture, higher education, or long-term
                        financial planning. You are also excellent at "fixing" broken systems. You have the Sagittarian
                        ability to see what's wrong with the big picture and the Saturnian ability to fix it at the
                        granular level.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are much more cautious than the average Sagittarius. You value security and are
                        likely to invest in things that are "real"—real estate, precious metals, or long-term government
                        bonds. You view money as a tool for stability. Your challenge is to allow yourself to spend some
                        of your hard-earned resources on the experiences and travel that your Sagittarian soul truly
                        craves.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your main health risk is <strong>stiffness—both physical and mental</strong>. Because you focus
                        so intensely and hold so much responsibility, your body can hold onto tension in the back,
                        knees, and joints. Yoga, regular stretching, and massage are essential for you. Sagittarius
                        rules the hips and thighs, so regular walking or hiking is the best way to keep your energy
                        flowing.</p>

                    <p>Mentally, you can suffer from "burnout" because you don't know when to quit. You need to learn
                        the art of <strong>play as medicine</strong>. Engaging in activities that have no "purpose" or
                        "goal"—like dancing, playing an instrument, or just wandering through a museum—will recharge
                        your battery in ways that "rest" cannot.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>inflexibility and a tendency toward pessimism</strong>. When your
                        grand visions meet the hard reality of the world, you can become cynical or controlling. You may
                        also judge others too harshly for not meeting your high standards of discipline. Your karmic
                        lesson is to learn <strong>Grace</strong>. Realizing that the world is imperfect—and that
                        imperfection is where the growth happens—is your key to spiritual peace.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>joy is a discipline too</strong>. It takes work to remain
                        optimistic and open-hearted when you are faced with the world's complexities. When you master
                        the discipline of joy, you become a truly unstoppable force.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The December 4th person is the <strong>Visionary Builder</strong>. You are the one who takes the
                        "dream" and turns it into the "deed." You are here to provide the structure for a more evolved
                        society. Your higher purpose is to <strong>Manifest Truth</strong>—to show the world that ideals
                        only matter when they are lived out in the real world with persistence and integrity. When you
                        build with love, you create monuments that last for lifetimes.</p>

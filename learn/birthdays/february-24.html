                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on February 24th, you are a Pisces whose life is defined by <strong>compassion, domestic
                            harmony, and a drive for unconditional love</strong>. You inhabit the <strong>first
                            decante</strong> of Pisces, ruled by <strong>Neptune (and traditional Jupiter)</strong>.
                        This gives you a natural connection to the divine and a deep well of spiritual insight. However,
                        the influence of the <strong>Number 24</strong> (which reduces to the harmonious <strong>Number
                            6</strong>)—the number of the caregiver, the artist, and the Venus-vibrated lover—adds a
                        layer of responsibility and a deep need to nurture. You are the "Sacred Guardian." While other
                        Pisceans might drift into the ether, you are the one who creates a warm, safe home where the
                        weary can rest.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Soulful Nurturer." You possess a highly receptive mind and a refusal to let anyone
                        suffer alone. You have a "healer-parent" dynamic: you feel the pain of the world (Pisces), but
                        you have the drive to fix it through loving service (Number 6). You aren't interested in
                        abstract spirituality; you are interested in the path that leads to <strong>healing, beauty, and
                            community</strong>. You have a natural sense of "aesthetics," often creating environments
                        that feel like a church or a sanctuary. You are here to learn that <strong>love is an action,
                            not just a feeling</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Neptune</strong>, the planet of dreams, illusion, and higher love.
                        This gives you your trademark empathy and artistic talent. However, the influence of
                        <strong>Venus</strong> (vibrated through the number 6 resonance) creates a truly soft and loving
                        alchemical mix. Neptune brings the divine love, while Venus brings the human love, the romance,
                        and the appreciation for beauty. You are a "Radiant Lover"—someone who sees the best in
                        everyone. You have a "truth-loving" heart that cannot bear ugliness or cruelty.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Water</strong>, is in its most nurturing and "life-giving" state. This
                        isn't a storm; it is <strong>the gentle rain or the healing spring</strong>—soothing,
                        consistent, and essential for growth. You have a steady emotional energy that demands connection
                        and harmony. You are here to learn that <strong>beauty is a form of healing</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as kind, gentle, and incredibly reliable. You have a "warmth" that
                        makes people feel instantly at home with you. You don't enjoy conflict or aggression and will
                        often go to great lengths to keep the peace. You have a natural sense of "duty"—you take your
                        commitments to your family and friends very seriously. You are likely a person of profound
                        artistic talent; whether you cook, garden, or paint, you bring a sense of harmony to everything
                        you touch. People find you "protective," but your protection is soft, like a warm blanket.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to martyrdom and over-giving</strong>. Because you love so
                        deeply, you may attract people who take advantage of your kindness. You are the "Saint" who
                        forgets that you also need to eat. Your persona is that of the "Mother/Father"—someone who cares
                        for the tribe regardless of the cost to self.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a February 24th person is a search for a "Divine Union." You are not interested in a
                        casual fling. You seek a "Life Partner"—someone to build a home and a family with. You are
                        incredibly romantic and devoted, often sacrificing your own desires for your partner's
                        happiness. You need a partner who appreciates your care and who returns it in kind.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the source of comfort and the keeper of the hearth. However, you can
                        be <strong>emotionally demanding in your need for appreciation</strong>. You cannot tolerate a
                        partner who is ungrateful or who takes your love for granted. You are best suited for Earth
                        signs (Taurus, Capricorn, Virgo) who value stability and family as much as you do, or Water
                        signs (Cancer, Scorpio) who understand your emotional depth. Fire signs might be too selfish for
                        you, while Air signs might be too detached.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>caregiving, the arts, education, or
                            counseling</strong>. Many born on this day become successful teachers, nurses, chefs,
                        interior designers, or social workers. You are a natural at "nurturing growth." You are best
                        when you are in a position where you can make a tangible difference in people's lives.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to be responsible and generous. You view money as <strong>a tool to
                            provide for your loved ones</strong>. You are the one who will naturally invest in a
                        beautiful home, quality food, and education. Your challenge is to ensure that you don't give it
                        all away. You are most successful when your "work" aligns with your heart.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>emotional boundaries and your throat</strong>. If
                        you swallow your feelings to keep the peace, you can suffer from thyroid issues or throat
                        infections. You need to learn the art of <strong>speaking your truth</strong>. Singing,
                        chanting, or simply saying "no" are essential for you.</p>

                    <p>Physically, you should avoid "comfort eating" as a way to deal with stress. Regular, gentle
                        physical activity like gardening, walking, or swimming is the best way to keep your energy
                        flowing. You are here to learn that <strong>caring for yourself is the first step in caring for
                            others</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>codependency and a fear of abandonment.</strong> You may stay in
                        toxic relationships because you believe you can "save" the person. You may also struggle with
                        guilt whenever you do something for yourself. Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Self-Love
                            and Independence</strong>. Realizing that you are worthy of love simply because you exist,
                        not because of what you do for others, is your key to freedom.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>conflict is sometimes necessary for growth.</strong> You
                        often avoid the hard conversations. Finding the courage to stand up for yourself allows you to
                        build relationships that are truly healthy.</p>

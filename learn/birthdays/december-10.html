                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 10th, you are a Sagittarius whose life is defined by <strong>pure individuality,
                            concentrated will, and the drive for pioneer status</strong>. You inhabit the second decante
                        of Sagittarius, ruled over by <strong>Mars</strong> and the sign of Aries. This grants you a
                        fierce competitive edge and an unrelenting drive to win. However, the influence of the
                        <strong>Number 10</strong>—which reduces to 1—brings in the powerful energy of the Sun. You are
                        the "Solar Archer." While other Sagittarians might wander looking for meaning, you wander to
                        establish your own kingdom and to show others what is possible when one trusts their own inner
                        light.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Pioneer of the Self." You possess a natural independence that can sometimes border
                        on isolation. You do not wait for permission to act, nor do you look for validation from the
                        crowd. You have a "first-best" mentality—you want to be the first to try a new idea, the first
                        to reach a new summit, and the best at whatever you put your mind to. You are here to learn that
                        <strong>leadership is a responsibility to serve, not just a right to rule</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, the planet of expansion, luck, and higher wisdom.
                        However, the secondary influence of the <strong>Sun</strong> (through the number 10) and
                        <strong>Mars</strong> (through the decante) creates a truly high-voltage personality. The Sun
                        brings ego, vitality, and a need to shine, while Mars brings the fire and the courage to take
                        risks. You are a "Triple-Fire" archetype—intense, radiant, and incredibly fast-moving. You have
                        a <strong>magnetism</strong> that draws people to you, often whether you want them there or not.
                    </p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is in its most concentrated "laser-like" state. You don't
                        just radiate heat; you focus it. This makes you incredibly effective at getting things done, but
                        it can also make you "burn" those who aren't prepared for your intensity. You are here to learn
                        that your <strong>passion is a fuel meant for creation, not consumption</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are seen as confident, authoritative, and deeply charismatic. You have a "larger
                        than life" quality. When you enter a room, the atmosphere shifts. You possess a natural dignity
                        and a refusal to engage in petty drama. You are likely a person of profound integrity; if you
                        give your word, you will move heaven and earth to keep it. You have little patience for
                        "small-minded" thinking or people who are afraid to take a stand.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to extreme arrogance and a "my way or the highway"
                            attitude</strong>. Because you see the vision so clearly and have the will to execute it,
                        you may find it difficult to listen to the advice of others. You are the "Sovereign" who expects
                        loyalty. Your persona is that of the "Hero"—someone who is always willing to take the lead in a
                        crisis, but who might struggle with the quiet, mundane details of daily life.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a December 10th person is a quest for a "Queen" or "King." You are not interested in a
                        partner you can easily dominate. You seek an equal—someone who is as strong, independent, and
                        radiant as you are. A "Power Couple" dynamic is your ideal. You are incredibly generous and
                        protective in love, but you also require <strong>absolute loyalty</strong>. If a partner betrays
                        your trust, you are unlikely to ever give them a second chance.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the protector and the provider of inspiration. However, you can be
                        <strong>emotionally demanding in your need for attention</strong>. You need to be seen and
                        appreciated by your partner. You are best suited for fellow Fire signs (Aries, Leo) who can
                        match your light, or Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) who can provide the intellectual "air"
                        to keep your fire burning. Earth and Water signs might find you too overwhelming, or struggle
                        with your lack of domesticity.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>leadership, entrepreneurship, the arts, or high-stakes
                            competition</strong>. Many born on this day become CEOs, visionary directors, innovative
                        tech leaders, or high-profile performers. You are a natural at spotting "the next big thing" and
                        having the guts to invest your everything into it. You are best when you are the "Master of your
                        own Fate"—working for yourself or in a position where you have total autonomy.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to experience great success, but you are also a "big spender." You
                        view money as a tool for <strong>expansion and self-expression</strong>. You are the one who
                        will pick up the check for the entire table, not because you are trying to impress them, but
                        because you genuinely believe in abundance. Your challenge is to ensure that your "generosity"
                        doesn't outpace your actual resources. You are most successful when your "work" is directly tied
                        to your personal brand.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your vitality is your greatest asset. You have a "solar battery" that seems to recharge itself.
                        However, you are <strong>prone to over-extension</strong>. You push your body to its absolute
                        limits, often ignoring the early warning signs of fatigue. Sagittarius rules the hips and
                        thighs, while the Sun (number 10) rules the heart and spine. You need regular, vigorous exercise
                        to burn off your excess fire—think competitive sports, trekking, or heavy weightlifting.</p>

                    <p>Mentally, you can suffer from <strong>"isolation fatigue."</strong> Because you lead so often,
                        you can feel that no one truly understands the weight you carry. Learning to delegate and to
                        trust others is your most powerful health practice. You are here to learn that
                        <strong>vulnerability is the highest form of strength</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>egotism and a refusal to see your own flaws</strong>. When your
                        path is blocked, you can become tyrannical or deeply resentful. You may also struggle with a
                        "divine right" complex, believing that your vision is the only one that matters. Your karmic
                        lesson is to learn <strong>Humility and the Power of the Group</strong>. Realizing that even
                        theSun needs the sky to shine in, and that your power is meant to illuminate others, not just
                        yourself, is your key to joy.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>it is okay to be "ordinary" sometimes</strong>. Finding
                        peace in the quiet moments when the spotlight isn't on you is where your true spiritual growth
                        happens. When you find your internal light, you no longer need the world's applause.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The December 10th person is the <strong>Conscious Creator of Reality</strong>. You are the one
                        who has the will to turn the impossible into the actual. You are here to <strong>Lead the

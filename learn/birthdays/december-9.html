                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 9th, you are a Sagittarius whose life is defined by <strong>courage, conviction,
                            and unrelenting action</strong>. You inhabit the second decante of Sagittarius, ruled over
                        by <strong>Mars</strong> and the sign of Aries. However, the influence of the <strong>Number
                            9</strong> (also ruled by Mars) creates a double-dose of Martian energy that makes you the
                        "Warrior-Priest" of the zodiac. You are not content with merely thinking about ideas or
                        preaching them; you are here to fight for them, live them, and manifest them in the heat of
                        battle.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Ethical Crusader." You possess a powerful moral compass that guides every action you
                        take. While other Sagittarians might wander because they enjoy the journey, you wander because
                        you are looking for a cause worthy of your intense devotion. You have a natural authority and a
                        magnetic presence that can inspire entire groups to follow your lead into the unknown. You are
                        here to learn that <strong>force is most powerful when it is guided by wisdom</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, the planet of expansion and philosophy. This
                        gives you your "Big Picture" view of the world. However, the triple influence of
                        <strong>Mars</strong> (through both the number 9 and the second decante) adds a level of
                        intensity and physical drive that is rare for your sign. Mars brings fire, competition, and a
                        "never back down" attitude. You are a "High-Frequency" individual—your life tends to move at a
                        faster pace than those around you.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is in its most explosive and radiant state. This is the fire
                        of the <strong>solar flare</strong>—powerful, unpredictable, and capable of both massive
                        destruction and massive enlightenment. You have a restless physical energy that must be
                        channeled into productive work or physical activity. You are here to learn that <strong>true
                            courage is the ability to maintain your ideals when the fire is at its hottest</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as charismatic, intense, and perhaps a bit "too much" for some
                        people. You don't do anything halfway; whether you are debating a point, playing a sport, or
                        working on a project, you give it 100% of your energy. You have a natural sense of "justice" and
                        will be the first to speak out against a perceived unfairness. You are likely the person who
                        stands up for the underdog, often placing yourself at risk to do so.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to impatience and a "holier-than-thou" attitude</strong>.
                        Because your moral compass is so strong, you may find it difficult to understand why others
                        don't see the world as clearly as you do. You are the "General" who expects everyone to be as
                        committed to the cause as you are. Your persona is that of the "Enlightened Soldier"—someone who
                        is always prepared for the next challenge.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a December 9th person is a passionate adventure. You are attracted to partners who are
                        as strong, independent, and idealistic as you are. A partner who is stagnant, manipulative, or
                        lacks a sense of purpose will eventually lose your interest. You seek a
                        <strong>"Comrade-in-Arms"</strong>—someone who will fight by your side for a better world. You
                        are incredibly loyal, but you require a high degree of freedom and respect for your individual
                        mission.</p>

                    <p>Unexpectedly, beneath your fiery exterior, you are deeply sensitive and surprisingly vulnerable
                        with those you truly trust. You express your love through <strong>loyalty, protection, and
                            shared vision</strong>. You are best suited for Fellow Fire signs (Aries, Leo) who can match
                        your intensity, or Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) who can provide the intellectual "fuel"
                        for your fire. Earth and Water signs might find your intensity too overwhelming for a daily
                        domestic life.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>leadership, advocacy, extreme sports, or hazardous
                            environments</strong>. Many born on this day become athletes, surgeons, human rights
                        activists, military leaders, or innovative entrepreneurs. You are excellent at "damage control"
                        and thrive in high-pressure situations. You have a talent for making quick decisions and a
                        natural ability to command resources when they are needed most.</p>

                    <p>Financially, your life can be "feast or famine." You are a natural risk-taker and may gamble on a
                        vision that others think is impossible. However, your intense drive usually ensures that you
                        find a way to land on your feet. You value money only for the freedom and the "supplies" it
                        provides for your missions. Your challenge is to learn a bit more <strong>Saturnian
                            patience</strong> so that you can build a more stable foundation for your long-term goals.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your vitality is immense, but you are <strong>prone to injuries and burnout</strong>. Because you
                        move so fast and push yourself so hard, your body can experience "wear and tear" earlier than
                        most. Sagittarius rules the hips and thighs, while Mars rules the head and face. You need to be
                        careful with physical activities that involve high speed or high impact. Regular "cooling"
                        activities like swimming or spending time in quiet, green spaces are essential to balance your
                        internal heat.</p>

                    <p>Mentally, you can suffer from <strong>chronic "righteous anger."</strong> If you feel the world
                        is too unfair, your physical health will suffer. Learning the art of <strong>forgiveness and
                            perspective</strong> is your most powerful medicine. You are here to learn that you cannot
                        carry the entire weight of the world's injustice on your own shoulders.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>fanaticism and a lack of empathy</strong>. When you are focused
                        on the "Goal," you might forget the "Humans" involved. You may also struggle with a "hero
                        complex," believing that only you can save the day. Your karmic lesson is to learn
                        <strong>Humility and Collaboration</strong>. Realizing that the greatest victories are won
                        together, and that everyone has a valuable perspective (even those who disagree with you), is
                        your key to spiritual evolution.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>the greatest battle is the one within</strong>.
                        Conquering your own impatience and your own ego is a far greater victory than any external
                        conquest. When you master your own internal fire, you become a truly enlightened teacher.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The December 9th person is the <strong>Spiritual Guardian of Truth</strong>. You are the one who
                        has the courage to speak the truth when others are silent. You are here to <strong>Lead through
                            Action</strong>. Your higher purpose is to show the world that ideals are worth fighting
                        for, and that courage is the highest form of worship. When you use your great power to defend
                        the weak and elevate the truth, you are truly a force for miracles.</p>

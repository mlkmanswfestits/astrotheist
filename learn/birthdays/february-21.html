                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on February 21st, you are a Pisces whose life is defined by <strong>artistic expression,
                            social optimism, and a drive for creative freedom</strong>. You inhabit the <strong>first
                            decante</strong> of Pisces, ruled by <strong>Neptune (and traditional Jupiter)</strong>.
                        This gives you high-level intuition and a natural connection to the invisible world. However,
                        the influence of the <strong>Number 21</strong> (which reduces to the creative <strong>Number
                            3</strong>)—the number of communication, joy, and Jupiterian expansion—adds a surprising
                        layer of social charm and articulateness. You are the "Expressive Mystic." While other Pisceans
                        might be silent dreamers, you are the one who paints the dream, sings the song, or writes the
                        book that explains the mystery to the world.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Soulful Communicator." You possess a highly imaginative mind and a need to
                        externalize your inner vision. You have a "creator-performer" dynamic: you feel the spiritual
                        currents (Pisces), but you have the drive to share them with an audience (Number 3). You aren't
                        interested in suffering in silence; you are interested in the path that leads to
                        <strong>collective joy and artistic validation</strong>. You have a natural sense of "flow,"
                        moving through life with a charm that opens doors. You are here to learn that <strong>your voice
                            is a healing instrument</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Neptune</strong>, the planet of dreams, illusion, and higher love.
                        This gives you your trademark empathy and artistic talent. However, the influence of
                        <strong>Jupiter</strong> (vibrated through both the traditional rulership of Pisces and the
                        number 3 resonance) creates a truly expansive and optimistic alchemical mix. Neptune brings the
                        depth, while Jupiter brings the luck, the growth, and the desire to "go big." You are a "Radiant
                        Storyteller"—someone who can weave a spell with words or images. You have a "truth-expanding"
                        heart that wants to believe in the best possible outcome.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Water</strong>, is in its most effervescent and "sparkling" state. This
                        isn't a stagnant pool; it is <strong>a fountain or a bubbling brook</strong>—alive, moving, and
                        reflecting the light. You have a social emotional energy that demands connection and feedback.
                        You are here to learn that <strong>joy is a spiritual practice</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as friendly, charming, and a bit "otherworldly." You have a
                        "sparkle" in your eye that makes people want to be near you. You don't enjoy boredom or routine
                        and will often seek out the colorful, the dramatic, and the beautiful. You have a natural sense
                        of "style"—whether it's fashion, decor, or just the way you tell a story. You are likely a
                        person of many talents; you might act, sing, paint, or simply live with a flair that is
                        enviable. People find you "inspiring," and your optimism is contagious.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to scattering your energy and avoiding the "boring"
                            truth</strong>. Because you love the high of creation, you may struggle with the discipline
                        of finishing what you start. You are the "Eternal Child" of the zodiac who expects the world to
                        be a playground. Your persona is that of the "Bard"—someone who holds the emotional history of
                        the tribe and transforms it into beauty.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a February 21st person is a search for a "Romantic Adventure." You are not interested in
                        a dry or pragmatic partnership. You seek a "Muse"—someone who inspires you and who is willing to
                        play in the realms of imagination with you. You are incredibly flirtatious and affectionate,
                        often expressing your love through grand gestures or creative gifts. You need a partner who
                        finds your quirks adorable rather than annoying.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the source of fun and the keeper of romance. However, you can be
                        <strong>emotionally demanding in your need for attention and validation</strong>. You cannot
                        tolerate a partner who ignores you or who dampens your enthusiasm. You are best suited for
                        fellow Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio) who understand your depth, or Air signs (Gemini, Libra) who
                        can keep up with your mental and social agility. Fire signs (Leo, Sagittarius) are often a
                        fantastic match, fueling your creativity, while Earth signs might feel too heavy unless they
                        have a creative streak.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>expression, entertainment, media, or the visual
                            arts</strong>. Many born on this day become successful writers, actors, designers,
                        marketers, or social influencers. You are a natural at "selling the dream." You are best when
                        you are in a position where your personality is an asset rather than a liability.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to experience cycles of feast and famine unless you learn to budget.
                        You view money as <strong>a means to enjoy life</strong>. You are the one who will naturally
                        invest in experiences, parties, and beauty. Your challenge is to ensure that your "generosity"
                        doesn't leave you broke. You are most successful when you monetize your unique creative voice.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>emotional expression and your nervous
                            system</strong>. If you stifle your creativity, you can suffer from throat issues
                        (expressing truth) or anxiety. You need to learn the art of <strong>creative release</strong>.
                        Singing, journaling, or dancing are essential for you.</p>

                    <p>Physically, you should avoid over-indulgence in sugar or alcohol, as your system is sensitive to
                        highs and lows. Regular, fun physical activity like Zumba, tennis, or hiking with friends is the
                        best way to keep your energy flowing. You are here to learn that <strong>your body is an
                            instrument of joy</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>superficiality and a refusal to "do the work."</strong> You may
                        rely on your charm to get by, avoiding the deep digging that true mastery requires. You may also
                        struggle with gossip or exaggeration. Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Discipline and
                            Depth</strong>. Realizing that true art requires structure, and that your words have power
                        to heal or harm, is your key to maturity.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>you don't have to be happy all the time.</strong> You
                        often hide your sadness behind a smile. Finding the courage to be authentic, even when you are
                        hurting, allows you to connect more deeply with others.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The February 21st person is the <strong>Voice of the Spirit</strong>. You are the one who
                        translates the ineffable into the understandable. You are here to <strong>inspire the
                            world</strong>. Your higher purpose is to remind us that life is a creative act—to show what

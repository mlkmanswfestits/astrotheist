                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on November 25th, you are the <strong>Spiritual Teacher</strong> of the zodiac. You are a
                        <strong>Sagittarius</strong>, ruled by Jupiter, and the <strong>vibration of the Number
                            7</strong> (2+5=7, Neptune/spirituality) introduces profound mysticism, introspection, and a
                        need for spiritual truth to your philosophical nature. You are the "Mystical
                        Philosopher"—someone who seeks truth through spiritual exploration and mystical understanding.
                        Unlike more worldly Sagittarians, you are drawn to the <strong>ultimate spiritual mysteries of
                            existence</strong>. You are here to learn that <strong>true wisdom is spiritual
                            wisdom</strong>.</p>
                    <p>You inhabit the archetype of the <strong>Spiritual Sage</strong>. You have Jupiter's expansive
                        wisdom combined with Neptune's mystical depth, creating a unique blend of philosophical and
                        spiritual understanding. Your spiritual blueprint is one of <strong>mystical wisdom</strong>.
                        You don't just seek knowledge; you seek enlightenment. Your journey involves balancing your need
                        for spiritual truth with the demands of physical reality. You are here to prove that
                        <strong>spirituality and wisdom can unite</strong>.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong> (Sagittarius), and the Number 7 amplifies
                        <strong>Neptune</strong>, creating a "Jupiterian-Neptunian Fusion." You are a "Spiritual
                        Philosopher," someone who seeks truth through mystical and spiritual exploration. You have a
                        "mystic-teacher" quality—capable of both philosophical wisdom and spiritual transcendence.</p>
                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is influenced by the "dissolving" quality of Neptune. This
                        makes your nature <strong>passionately spiritual, mystically wise, and transcendently
                            optimistic</strong>. You have enthusiasm for spiritual truth. You are here to learn to
                        <strong>channel your philosophical wisdom through spiritual depth</strong>. When you align your
                        Sagittarian optimism with Neptunian spirituality, you become a powerful spiritual teacher and
                        mystic.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you project "Spiritual Wisdom." You have an otherworldly yet optimistic presence that
                        inspires people to seek spiritual truth. You are often the "spiritual teacher" in your circles,
                        the one who combines philosophical insight with mystical depth. You have a "transformative
                        spirituality"—you're changing consciousness through teaching spiritual wisdom.</p>
                    <p>However, your persona can struggle with <strong>extreme sensitivity and spiritual
                            escapism</strong>. Your heightened spiritual sensitivity can make ordinary life feel
                        unbearable, and you may completely retreat into spirituality. Your challenge is the "Spiritual
                        Hermit's Trap"—the belief that spirituality requires complete withdrawal from the world. Your
                        persona is that of the "Embodied Spiritual Teacher"—someone who teaches spiritual wisdom while
                        remaining present in the world.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a November 25th person is a quest for "Spiritual Soul Connection." You want both
                        philosophical alignment and spiritual merger—someone who can explore spiritual truth with you.
                        You are deeply devoted but may struggle with human intimacy, seeking a partner who understands
                        that love is ultimately a spiritual practice. You <strong>require spiritual depth, philosophical
                            alignment, and soul-level connection</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In relationships, you are the "Spiritual Partner"—you create spiritually transformative,
                        philosophically aligned unions. However, you can be <strong>extremely idealistic or completely
                            avoid human intimacy for spiritual pursuits</strong>. You must learn that true love is
                        embodied, not just transcendent. You are best suited for fellow Fire signs (Aries, Leo) who
                        match your enthusiasm, or Water signs (Pisces, Cancer) who understand spiritual depth. Taurus
                        offers the embodiment that helps you stay present in love.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers involving <strong>spiritual teaching, mystical wisdom, transcendent
                            education, or spiritual guidance</strong>. November 25th individuals excel as spiritual
                        teachers, mystical philosophers, meditation instructors, or spiritual guides. You are a natural
                        at "teaching spiritual truth and philosophical wisdom." You are best in positions where you can
                        serve as a spiritual teacher and guide.</p>
                    <p>Financially, you are likely to find success through <strong>spiritual teaching or wisdom
                            work</strong>. You view money as <strong>energy that barely matters compared to spiritual
                            truth</strong>. You are the one who will teach at the spiritual center or write the wisdom
                        book. Your challenge is to value your physical needs. You are most successful when you trust
                        that the universe provides and allow abundance to support your spiritual mission.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>spiritual practice and energetic
                            boundaries</strong>. When you're not grounded spiritually or when you're absorbing too much
                        collective energy, it manifests as illness. You need activities that combine <strong>spiritual
                            depth and physical grounding</strong>—spiritual yoga, grounding meditation, or embodied
                        spiritual practices. Your immune system (Neptune), nervous system (sensitivity), hips/thighs
                        (Sagittarius), and liver (Jupiter) are key health areas.</p>
                    <p>Physically, watch your immune system, nervous system, hips, and liver. You are prone to
                        "spiritual burnout" or "psychic overwhelm." You need to learn the art of <strong>grounded
                            spirituality</strong>. Regular grounding practices, energetic protection, and activities
                        that anchor you in the body are essential. You are here to learn that <strong>the body is sacred
                            and necessary for spiritual work</strong>.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>spiritual escapism and the fear of material reality</strong>. You
                        may use spirituality to completely avoid dealing with physical life or human relationships. You
                        may also struggle with extreme sensitivity, becoming overwhelmed by ordinary existence. Your
                        karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Embodied Spirituality</strong>. Realizing that true
                        spirituality includes the material, not just the transcendent, is your path to wholeness.</p>
                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>spiritual wisdom must be grounded to be useful</strong>.
                        You often seek complete transcendence when embodied service is needed. Finding comfort in the
                        physical world and learning to value the material as sacred is where your deepest growth
                        happens. Your life's work is learning to be a grounded spiritual teacher who serves humanity.

                    <p>The November 25th person is the <strong>Spiritual Philosopher</strong>. You are here to show us
                        that true wisdom is spiritual, that the highest knowledge comes from mystical understanding. You

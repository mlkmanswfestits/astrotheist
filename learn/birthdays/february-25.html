                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on February 25th, you are a Pisces whose life is defined by <strong>mysticism, analytical
                            depth, and a drive for total spiritual understanding</strong>. You inhabit the <strong>first
                            decante</strong> of Pisces, ruled by <strong>Neptune (and traditional Jupiter)</strong>.
                        This gives you the purest dose of Piscean energy—surrendering, imaginative, and deeply psychic.
                        However, the influence of the <strong>Number 25</strong> (which reduces to the intuitive
                        <strong>Number 7</strong>)—the number of the philosopher, the researcher, and the
                        Neptune-vibrated truth-seeker—adds a layer of introversion and a need to answer the "big
                        questions." You are the "Mystic Scholar." While other Pisceans might be content to feel the
                        mystery, you are the one who wants to dissect it, understand it, and translate it into wisdom.
                    </p>

                    <p>You are the "Soulful Investigator." You possess a highly receptive mind and a refusal to accept
                        surface-level answers. You have a "scientist-monk" dynamic: you feel the divine (Pisces), but
                        you scrutinize it with the logic of the seeker (Number 7). You aren't interested in blind faith;
                        you are interested in the path that leads to <strong>direct gnosis and verifiable
                            truth</strong>. You have a natural sense of "silence," often preferring solitude to the
                        noise of the crowd. You are here to learn that <strong>the loudest voice is the one
                            within</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Neptune</strong>, which rules both your sign and your birth number
                        (7 vibrates to Neptune/Moon energy). This creates a "double dose" of Neptunian energy—intuition,
                        dreams, and psychic sensitivity are amplified to a master level. You are a "Radiant
                        Channel"—someone who is almost entirely open to the unseen worlds. You have a "truth-sensing"
                        soul that can detect a lie before it is even spoken.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Water</strong>, is in its most deep and "cavernous" state. This isn't the
                        surface waves; it is <strong>the underground river</strong>—hidden, pure, and flowing through
                        the bedrock of existence. You have a steady emotional energy that is private and profound. You
                        are here to learn that <strong>solitude is the laboratory of the soul</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as quiet, mysterious, and deeply intelligent. You have a "gaze"
                        that makes people feel they are being X-rayed. You don't enjoy small talk or superficiality and
                        will often stand on the edges of a party observing the human drama. You have a natural sense of
                        "integrity"—you cannot fake what you do not feel. You are likely a person of hidden talents; you
                        may write poetry no one sees, or practice a spiritual discipline in secret. People find you
                        "enigmatic," and they are often desperate to know what you are thinking.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to cynicism and isolation</strong>. Because you see
                        through the illusions of the world so clearly, you may become disillusioned with humanity. You
                        are the "Hermit" who retreats to the mountain to escape the noise. Your persona is that of the
                        "Sage"—someone who speaks rarely, but whose words carry the weight of truth.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a February 25th person is a search for a "Spiritual connection." You are not interested
                        in a partner who is merely physically attractive. You seek a "Soul Mirror"—someone who
                        understands the silence as well as the words. You are incredibly loyal but need a lot of
                        personal space. You need a partner who is independent, deep, and respectful of your need for
                        solitude.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the source of wisdom and the keeper of secrets. However, you can be
                        <strong>emotionally distant in your need for self-protection</strong>. You cannot tolerate a
                        partner who is invasive or loud. You are best suited for Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio) who share
                        your need for depth, or Earth signs (Virgo, Capricorn) who can provide a grounded container for
                        your spirit. Fire signs might be too exhausting for you, while Air signs might be too scattered.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>research, spirituality, psychology, or the
                            arts</strong>. Many born on this day become scientists, musicians, writers, theologians, or
                        investigators. You are a natural at "finding the needle in the haystack." You are best when you
                        are in a position where you can work alone or in a small, dedicated team.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to be uninterested in wealth for wealth's sake. You view money as
                        <strong>freedom from hassle</strong>. You are the one who will naturally invest in books,
                        instruments, and retreat centers. Your challenge is to ensure that you don't neglect the
                        material world entirely. You are most successful when your "work" allows you to deeply explore a
                        subject you love.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>mental peace and your immune system</strong>.
                        Because you are so sensitive, you are prone to auto-immune issues or mysterious allergies. You
                        need to learn the art of <strong>psychic cleansing</strong>. Meditation, time in nature, and
                        avoiding harsh chemicals are essential for you.</p>

                    <p>Physically, you should avoid heavy, processed foods. A clean, light diet rich in water and plants
                        is best. Gentle, meditative physical activity like Yoga or Tai Chi is the best way to keep your
                        energy flowing. You are here to learn that <strong>your body is a sensitive instrument that
                            needs fine-tuning</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>paranoia and a fear of being misunderstood.</strong> You may
                        assume that no one can "get" you, so you don't even try to explain. You may also struggle with
                        melancholy. Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Trust and Openness</strong>. Realizing that
                        there are others who share your frequency, and that sharing your inner world is safe, is your
                        key to connection.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>faith requires skepticism, but skepticism also requires
                            faith.</strong> You often get stuck in the analysis paralysis. Finding the balance between
                        the mind and the heart allows you to find true peace.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The February 25th person is the <strong>Mystic of the Mind</strong>. You are the one who bridges
                        the gap between science and spirit. You are here to <strong>prove the invisible</strong>. Your
                        higher purpose is to show that truth is not just a fact, but a feeling. When you trust your
                        intuition and share your findings, you help the world to see with new eyes.</p>

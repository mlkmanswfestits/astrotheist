                <div class="content-body" style="line-height: 2; font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--purple-soft);">
                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 5th, you are a Sagittarius whose life is a constant <strong>motion of mind and
                            body</strong>. You inhabit the first decante of Sagittarius, which is primarily ruled by
                        <strong>Jupiter</strong>, granting you an expansive spirit and a thirst for higher knowledge.
                        However, the influence of the <strong>Number 5</strong>—the number of Mercury—is so strong that
                        it almost overrides your sign's traditional Jupiterian weight with a sense of Mercurial
                        lightness. You are "the Traveler squared."</p>

                    <p>You are the "Global Nomad." While other Sagittarians might move because they seek a destination,
                        you move because you love the <strong>act of moving</strong>. You possess an incredibly
                        versatile mind that can learn new languages, adapt to new cultures, and master new technologies
                        with startling speed. You are the connective tissue between different places and different
                        ideas. You don't just find information; you translate it for the masses.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, which provides your core drive for freedom,
                        social justice, and expansion. However, the <strong>Mercury</strong> influence of the number 5
                        adds a second, faster rhythm to your life. Mercury makes you restless, communicative, and
                        multi-talented. This creates a fascinating internal dynamic: Jupiter wants you to think big,
                        while Mercury wants you to think fast. More often than not, you resolve this by becoming a "Fast
                        Thinker with Big Ideas."</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is highly combustible and intellectual. This is the fire of
                        the <strong>signal beacon</strong>—it is used to send messages across great distances. You are
                        likely an extremely expressive person who uses your hands, your voice, and your entire body when
                        you speak. You are here to learn that your restless energy is a gift meant to be used for
                        <strong>bridge-building and communication</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as magnetic, witty, and perhaps a bit "scattered." You always seem
                        to have three conversations going at once and four browser tabs open in your mind. People are
                        drawn to your energy because it is infectious; you make life feel like an exciting game that
                        everyone is invited to play. You are a natural-born salesperson—you can talk almost anyone into
                        almost anything because your enthusiasm is so genuine.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to excessive nervousness</strong>. Your mind moves so much
                        faster than your body that you can feel like you are perpetually "running behind." You hate
                        being bored or being forced to wait. You are the "Impulse" of the zodiac, often making decisions
                        based on a sudden flash of insight before you've even had a chance to consider the consequences.
                        Your persona is that of the "Enlightened Trickster."</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a December 5th person is an intellectual quest. You are attracted to partners who are as
                        smart, fast, and independent as you are. A partner who is too "heavy," jealous, or demanding of
                        your time will find you slipping through their fingers like smoke. You need a <strong>Mental
                            Playmate</strong>—someone who can keep up with your changing interests and your sudden need
                        to drive three hours in the middle of the night just to see the sunrise.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are incredibly fun and generous, but you can be difficult to ground. You
                        express your love through <strong>shared adventures and intense conversations</strong>. You are
                        best suited for Fellow Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) who speak your mental language, or
                        Fire signs (Aries, Leo) who can match your physical energy. Earth signs might find you too
                        unreliable, while Water signs might find your lack of emotional "nesting" instincts deeply
                        unsettling.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that offer <strong>constant change, travel, and communication</strong>. You
                        make an excellent journalist, pilot, marketer, software developer, or public speaker. You are
                        also a natural at "startups"—you love the high-energy beginning of a project but might find the
                        long-term maintenance boring. You are best when you are the "Face" or the "Voice" of an
                        organization.</p>

                    <p>Financially, your life can be a bit of a gamble. The Number 5 influence makes you prone to taking
                        risks, and your Jupiterian optimism makes you believe you can't lose. You are likely to
                        experience sudden windfalls followed by periods of "creative budgeting." You value money only
                        for the travel and experiences it allows. Your challenge is to automate your savings so that
                        your "Future Self" is taken care of while your "Current Self" is off on an adventure.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>nervous system</strong>. You are highly sensitive to
                        stress, noise, and over-stimulation. You are prone to "Mercury burnout"—mental exhaustion that
                        manifests as insomnia, digestive issues, or twitching. You need to learn the art of
                        <strong>silence</strong>. Spending time in nature, away from screens and noise, is your most
                        powerful medicine. Sagittarius rules the hips and thighs, so regular movement like cycling or
                        dance is essential to ground your nervous energy.</p>

                    <p>You also need to watch your "breath." Many born on this day take shallow breaths because they are
                        always in a hurry. Deep, conscious breathing exercises (Pranayama) can do wonders for your
                        physical and mental health. You are here to learn that <strong>slowing down actually allows you
                            to go further</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>fecal-mindedness and a lack of depth</strong>. Because you move
                        so fast, you can be tempted to skim the surface of everything without ever truly mastering
                        anything. You can also struggle with commitment—not just in relationships, but in projects and
                        philosophies. Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Depth and Persistence</strong>. Realizing
                        that the greatest treasures are often buried deep, not just scattered on the surface, is your
                        key to spiritual maturity.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>freedom is an internal state</strong>. You don't always
                        need to change your location to find it. When you find the "still point" within yourself, you
                        can be free even in the middle of a crowded room.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The December 5th person is the <strong>Messenger of Universal Truth</strong>. You are here to
                        move information and energy from one place to another. Your higher purpose is to <strong>Bridge
                            the Divide</strong>—to show people that despite our different languages, cultures, and
                        beliefs, we are all part of the same grand human experiment. When you use your quick mind and
                        fast feet to serve a higher cause, you are a truly enlightened guide.</p>

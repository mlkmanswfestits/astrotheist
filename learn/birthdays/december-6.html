                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 6th, you are a Sagittarius who exemplifies <strong>balance and aesthetic
                            sensitivity</strong>. You inhabit the second decante of Sagittarius, which is traditionally
                        associated with the sign of Aries and ruled by <strong>Mars</strong>. This gives you an
                        underlying competitive edge and a powerful drive. However, the influence of the <strong>Number
                            6</strong>—the number of Venus—adds a layer of social grace, artistic talent, and a deep
                        need for connection that is rare for your sign. You are the "Artist-Warrior" of the zodiac.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Diplomatic Seeker." While other Sagittarians might be blunt to the point of
                        rudeness, you have a natural ability to speak difficult truths with such grace and charm that
                        people actually thank you for it. You believe that truth is only effective when it is delivered
                        in a way that people can actually receive. You are the person who brings beauty to the
                        battlefield of ideas, ensuring that the mission is not only successful but also meaningful and
                        aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, the planet of expansion and wisdom. Jupiter
                        grants you your core optimism and your need for a wide "playground" in which to live your life.
                        However, the secondary influence of <strong>Venus</strong> (manifested through the number 6) and
                        <strong>Mars</strong> (through the second decante) creates a fascinating internal tension. Mars
                        wants you to go, go, go, while Venus wants you to stop and smell the roses. You resolve this by
                        becoming a "High-Energy Esthete"—someone who pursues beauty and truth with unrelenting passion.
                    </p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is refined by the Venusian influence, turning the wild
                        prairie fire into a <strong>brilliant, focused light</strong>. You are likely an extremely
                        magnetic person with a strong physical presence. You have a natural talent for "staging" your
                        life—ensuring that your environment, your clothes, and your social circles all reflect your
                        inner sense of harmony. You are here to learn that <strong>beauty is a form of truth</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as charming, sophisticated, and perhaps a bit "otherworldly." You
                        have a natural sense of "fairness" and will often step in to mediate conflicts, even when you
                        aren't asked to. People trust you because they sense that you aren't just looking for your own
                        benefit, but for the benefit of the whole. You are a natural leader who leads through
                        inspiration and collective vision rather than through authority.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to extreme idealism</strong>. You want the world to be
                        better, kinder, and more beautiful than it actually is, and you can become deeply depressed when
                        reality doesn't live up to your high standards. Your persona is that of the "Noble
                        Crusader"—someone who is willing to fight for a cause, but only if that cause is just and the
                        fight is handled with honor.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love is the central theme of your life. Unlike the "loner" Sagittarians, you are almost always
                        seeking a partner. You are a romantic visionary who seeks a "Great Love"—someone who is not just
                        a companion but a co-creator of a beautiful life. You are incredibly generous, supportive, and
                        protective of those you love. You express your love through <strong>generous gifts, shared
                            travel, and creating a beautiful home sanctuary</strong>.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you need a partner who can match your intensity but also provide a sense of
                        stability. You do not do well with coldness, criticism, or lack of vision. You are best suited
                        for fellow Fire signs (Aries, Leo) who share your passion, or Air signs (Gemini, Libra) who
                        share your social intelligence. Water and Earth signs might find your constant need for
                        expansion and your high ideals a bit too much to manage on a daily basis.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>esthetics, advocacy, diplomacy, or the arts</strong>.
                        Many born on this day become fashion designers, human rights lawyers, diplomats, architects, or
                        teachers of the arts. You are excellent in any role where you can "humanize" a system or a
                        product. You have a natural talent for recognizing what is "valuable" before the rest of the
                        world does.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to be successful because you have the drive to work hard and the
                        taste to attract wealth. However, you can also be <strong>irresponsibly generous</strong>. You
                        might find yourself helping others at the expense of your own security. You value money only for
                        the freedom and beauty it can buy. Your challenge is to learn that "self-care" is not
                        selfish—you cannot continue to be a benefactor for others if your own cup is empty.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>emotional and aesthetic balance</strong>. If your
                        environment is chaotic or your relationships are in conflict, you will literally feel it in your
                        body. You are prone to issues with the hips, kidneys (Venusian influence), and lower back.
                        Regular exercise is essential, but it should be something that also feeds your soul—like hiking
                        in a beautiful place, dance, or martial arts which requires grace as well as strength.</p>

                    <p>You also need to watch for "over-adrenalization." Your Mars influence means you run at a high
                        speed, while your Venus influence means you take in a lot of emotional data. This can lead to
                        exhaustion. Learning the art of <strong>intentional downtime</strong>—where you do absolutely
                        nothing in a beautiful, quiet space—is your primary health practice.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>indecision and a fear of being "unpleasant."</strong> Because you
                        value harmony so much, you may suppress your true feelings or your fiery Mars-drive to keep the
                        peace. You may also struggle with a "God-complex," believing that you are the only one who truly
                        knows what is "right" or "beautiful." Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Healthy
                            Conflict</strong>. Realizing that a good, honest argument can often lead to deeper harmony
                        than a quiet, polite suppression of truth is your key to maturity.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>beauty is not just for the elite</strong>. Bringing your
                        sense of high vision to the common, everyday world is where your true spiritual power lies. When
                        you stop "judging" the world and start "adoring" it, you find the grace you have been seeking.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.
                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The December 6th person is the <strong>Ambassador of Divine Harmony</strong>. You are the one who
                        makes the "struggle for truth" look beautiful. You are here to remind us that we aren't just
                        fighting for survival; we are fighting for a world worth living in. Your higher purpose is to
                        <strong>Manifest Grace</strong>—to show that power and beauty are not opposites, but two hands
                        of the same creator. When you lead with your heart and your vision, you inspire a more elegant

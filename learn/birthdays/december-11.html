                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on December 11th, you are a Sagittarius whose journey is defined by <strong>high
                            sensitivity, spiritual insight, and intense internal vibration</strong>. You inhabit the
                        final degrees of the second decante of Sagittarius, ruled over by <strong>Mars</strong> and the
                        sign of Aries. This grants you a courageous, proactive spirit. However, the influence of the
                        <strong>Master Number 11</strong>—the number of the visionary and the psychic—is the defining
                        feature of your soul. You are a "Metaphysical Firebrand." While other Sagittarians explore the
                        outer world, you are frequently diving into the depths of the psyche and the mysteries of the
                        unseen world.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Channel for Higher Wisdom." You possess a restless curiosity that isn't satisfied
                        with surface-level explanations. You have a natural "psychic sensitivity" that allows you to
                        pick up on the hidden nuances of any situation or person. You may often feel like an "outsider,"
                        not because you are anti-social, but because your internal frequency is simply different from
                        the majority of the population. You are here to learn how to ground your intense
                        <strong>spiritual visions into physical reality</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Jupiter</strong>, the planet of expansion and philosophy. However,
                        the secondary influence of the <strong>Master Number 11</strong> (associated with Neptune and
                        Uranus) and <strong>Mars</strong> (through the decante) creates a complex alchemical mix.
                        Neptune brings the intuition and the dream-state, while Mars brings the drive and the courage to
                        actually do something about your visions. You are a "Dreamer who Operates"—someone who can tap
                        into a high-level truth and then immediately try to weaponize it for good in the real world.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is in a "white-hot" state. This isn't the roaring bonfire of
                        December 3rd or the laser of December 10th; it is the <strong>pure, glowing light of the
                            spirit</strong>. You are prone to sudden, deep flashes of enlightenment. Your life is likely
                        characterized by "quantum leaps"—periods of sudden, massive evolution where your entire
                        world-view changes overnight. You are here to learn that your <strong>sensitivity is your
                            primary strength</strong>, even when the world tells you it is a weakness.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as enigmatic, intellectual, and perhaps a bit "high-strung." You
                        have a very "intense" presence that makes people feel like they are being seen at their deepest
                        level. You don't enjoy shallow gossip and will often find yourself in the role of the
                        "counselor" or the "truth-teller," even in casual social situations. You are a natural-born
                        teacher, often possessing a vast store of knowledge on unconventional or spiritual subjects.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to extreme bouts of nervous anxiety</strong>. Because your
                        system takes in so much more data than the average person, you can easily become
                        over-stimulated. You hate being restricted or forced into a mundane routine. You are the
                        "Light-Bringer" who might accidentally blind others with your intensity if you haven't learned
                        how to modulate your output. Your persona is that of the "Enlightened Eccentric."</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a December 11th person is a soul-to-soul commitment. You are not interested in the
                        "social game" of dating. You seek a "Conscious Partnership"—someone who can handle your intense
                        energy and your need for deep, meaningful connection. You need a partner who is intellectually
                        as well as spiritually awake. You are incredibly loyal, but you can also be <strong>emotionally
                            demanding in your need for total transparency</strong>.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are a powerful catalyst for your partner's healing. You will intuitively
                        know what is bothering them before they do. You are best suited for fellow Fire signs (Aries,
                        Leo) who can match your intensity, or Water signs (Scorpio, Pisces) who share your depth and
                        emotional intelligence. Air signs might provide the intellectual stimulation you love, but Earth
                        signs might find your high-frequency nature too "impractical" for a traditional domestic life.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that allow for <strong>healing, spiritual counseling, innovative arts, or
                            humanitarian leadership</strong>. Many born on this day become psychologists, metaphysical
                        teachers, musicians, poets, or social innovators. You are excellent at "seeing the soul" of a
                        project or a person. You are best when you are working on the "cutting edge" of
                        consciousness—where you can translate complex truths into understandable forms.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you have an "energetic" relationship with money. You value it only for the freedom
                        it provides to follow your calling. You may experience sudden "manifestation" cycles where money
                        shows up exactly when you need it for a specific project. However, you can also be <strong>prone
                            to neglect the material foundation</strong> in favor of the spiritual vision. Your challenge
                        is to learn that "abundance" is a spiritual law that includes the material world. You are most
                        successful when your work is an authentic expression of your soul's purpose.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>nervous system and your psychic hygiene</strong>.
                        Because you are a "Master Number 11," you are a psychic sponge. If you are in a chaotic or
                        low-vibration environment, you will develop unexplained health issues—often headaches, digestive
                        sensitivity, or chronic fatigue. You need to learn the art of <strong>grounding</strong>.
                        Walking barefoot on the earth, regular meditation, and time by the water are essential. Water is
                        your most powerful medicine.</p>

                    <p>Physically, you should watch your feet and your circulation. Regular, calm physical activity like
                        Tai Chi or swimming is much better for you than high-intensity "Mars" type workouts. You are
                        here to learn that <strong>silence is a physiological requirement</strong> for your well-being.
                        Regular "digital detoxes" are a must.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>indecision and spiritual escapism</strong>. When the world gets
                        too harsh, you may be tempted to retreat into your own mind or into "intellectual superiority"
                        to avoid dealing with reality. You may also struggle with a "God-complex," believing that you
                        are the only one who truly "knows." Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Grace and
                            Practicality</strong>. Realizing that the "spirit" is meant to be lived out in the body, and
                        that the mundane world is just as sacred as the higher realms, is your key to fulfillment.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>it is okay to be "misunderstood."</strong> You often
                        suppress your brilliance because you fear rejection. When you find the courage to share your
                        unique visions with the world, you become a powerful catalyst for the evolution of those around
                        you.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VIII.

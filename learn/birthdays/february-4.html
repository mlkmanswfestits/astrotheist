                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Power of Structure</h2>
                    <p>While the previous day (February 3rd) was characterized by social sparkle and Jupiterian
                        expansion, the energy of February 4th is decidedly more rigorous. Those born on this day carry
                        the signature of the Aquarian visionary, but it is tempered by the gravity and structure of the
                        <strong>Number 4</strong>. In numerology, 4 is the number of the foundation, the square, and the
                        builder. This makes the February 4th individual an anomaly in the Aquarian world: a rebel who
                        actually values order.</p>

                    <p>You are not interested in change for change's sake. You want to build systems that last. You
                        possess the Aquarian ability to see far into the future, but you have the Saturnian discipline
                        (Saturn being the traditional ruler of Aquarius) to map out every single step required to get
                        there. You are the "Systems Thinker"—the one who organizes the revolution so that it actually
                        succeeds.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Being born in the second decante of Aquarius, you are influenced by <strong>Uranus</strong> (the
                        modern ruler) and <strong>Mercury</strong> (the sub-ruler via Gemini). This grants you an
                        incredibly fast, data-driven mind. However, the numerological 4 brings a secondary influence of
                        <strong>Saturn</strong>. This creates a fascinating internal tension: Uranus wants to break the
                        rules, while Saturn wants to master them. More often than not, you resolve this by mastering the
                        rules so thoroughly that you can rewrite them better than anyone else.</p>

                    <p>Your element is <strong>Air</strong>, but it is an Air that is cold and focused. You are less
                        like a gentle breeze and more like a high-altitude jet stream—powerful, directional, and
                        essential to the global ecosystem. You value truth over comfort and logic over sentimentality.
                        To you, the universe is a giant machine, and your life's work is to understand its mechanics.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>People often perceive you as serious, focused, and perhaps a bit detached. You do not suffer
                        fools gladly, and you have little patience for small talk or emotional manipulation. You are the
                        person people go to when they need an objective, unbiased opinion or a complex problem solved.
                        Your presence is grounding, yet you always seem to be looking "through" people at the underlying
                        structures of their lives.</p>

                    <p>Your sense of humor is typically dry, sharp, and very observant. You are often the funniest
                        person in the room exactly because you are the one least trying to be funny. You value integrity
                        above all else. If you give your word, you keep it, which makes you a rare and valuable anchor
                        in the otherwise flighty world of intellectualism.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>In love, you are slow to commit. You view relationships as an investment of your most precious
                        resource: time. You are looking for a partner who is not just a companion, but a teammate. You
                        need someone who has their own ambitions and who respects your need for space and intellectual
                        freedom. You are not a "clingy" lover, and you will quickly exit any relationship that feels
                        stifling or irrational.</p>

                    <p>Unexpectedly, once you do commit, you are incredibly steadfast. Your partner knows they can rely
                        on you for everything from financial planning to emotional stability. You express your love
                        through <strong>acts of service and intellectual sharing</strong>. For you, a deep conversation
                        about the future of humanity is more romantic than a candlelit dinner. You are most compatible
                        with Earth signs (Capricorn, Virgo) who appreciate your discipline, or Air signs (Gemini, Libra)
                        who can match your mental frequency.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>Success is almost guaranteed for the February 4th person, provided they find a field they truly
                        believe in. You possess an incredible work ethic that is rare for your sign. You are well-suited
                        for careers in <strong>engineering, computer science, architecture, law, or high-level
                            management</strong>. You thrive when you are given a chaotic mess and told to make it
                        efficient.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are cautious and strategic. You are unlikely to gamble on "get rich quick"
                        schemes. Instead, you prefer to build wealth through consistent, disciplined effort. You value
                        security, but you also value the freedom that money provides. You are the type of person who has
                        a five-year plan, a ten-year plan, and a retirement account that is growing steadily because you
                        understand the power of compound interest—both in finance and in life.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your main health risk is <strong>stiffness—both physical and mental</strong>. Because you work so
                        hard and focus so intensely, your body can hold onto tension, particularly in the joints, knees,
                        and ankles. Yoga, stretching, and regular massage are not luxuries for you; they are essential
                        maintenance. You also need to watch for "burnout." Your mind is a high-performance engine, but
                        it cannot run at 100% capacity forever without downtime.</p>

                    <p>Emotionally, you tend to repress your feelings in favor of logic. This can lead to psychosomatic
                        symptoms—unexplained aches or digestive issues that are actually rooted in unexpressed stress.
                        Learning to acknowledge your feelings as "data points" that deserve attention is a key part of
                        your health journey.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest challenge is <strong>inflexibility</strong>. You can become so convinced of your
                        own logical conclusions that you become dogmatic or cold. You may dismiss anyone who doesn't
                        meet your high standards for intellectual rigor. Your karmic lesson is to learn that
                        <strong>vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness</strong>. Allowing yourself to be "wrong" or
                        to be "soft" is the final frontier of your personal evolution.</p>

                    <p>You are here to learn that the "foundation" (the Number 4) needs to be built on love and human
                        connection, not just on rules and data. When you learn to integrate your massive intellectual
                        power with a sense of playfulness and warmth, you become a truly unstoppable force for good in
                        the world.</p>

                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The February 4th person is the <strong>Architect of the New Age</strong>. You are the one who
                        takes the wild, Uranian flashes of inspiration and turns them into reality. You are the bridge
                        between the dream and the deed. Your life is about showing the world that freedom (Aquarius) and
                        responsibility (Saturn/Number 4) are not opposites, but two sides of the same coin. When you
                        build with heart as well as mind, you create something that will outlast your own lifetime.</p>

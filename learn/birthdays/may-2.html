                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">I. The
                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on May 2nd, you are a Taurus whose life is defined by <strong>partnership, aesthetic
                            harmony, and a drive for emotional security</strong>. You inhabit the <strong>first
                            decante</strong> of Taurus, ruled by <strong>Venus</strong>. This gives you your trademark
                        appreciation for quality, comfort, and the arts. However, the influence of the <strong>Number
                            2</strong>—the number of the Moon, duality, and sensitivity—introduces a layer of deep
                        intuition and a need for connection that is often more pronounced than in other Taureans. You
                        are the "Diplomatic Guardian of the Earth." While other Taureans might build for themselves, you
                        build for <strong>us</strong>—creating environments where people feel safe, nourished, and
                        deeply seen.</p>

                    <p>You are the "Intuitive Empathetic." You possess a mind that is constantly scanning the atmosphere
                        for discord. You have a "harmonizer-protector" dynamic: you want the stability of the material
                        world, but you know that true stability is impossible without emotional peace. You aren't
                        interested in a cold or sterile success; you are here to experience the <strong>triumph of love
                            and beauty over chaos</strong>. You have a natural sense of "timing" when it comes to the
                        feelings of others, making you an exceptional listener and a steady anchor. You are here to
                        learn that <strong>your sensitivity is your greatest spiritual asset</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Venus</strong>, the planet of values, pleasure, and relationships.
                        This gives you your natural charm and your eye for design. However, the secondary influence of
                        the <strong>Moon</strong> (vibrated through the number 2) creates a truly soft and receptive
                        alchemical mix. Venus brings the social grace and the taste, while the Moon adds the depth, the
                        nurturing instinct, and the tendency toward emotional cyclicality. You are a "Lunar Sovereign of
                        the Earth"—someone who can command with both unyielding loyalty and intense personal warmth.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Earth</strong>, is in its most fertile and receptive state. This isn't just
                        soil; it is <strong>the damp earth of a shaded grove</strong>—cool, supportive, and absolutely
                        essential for the growth of the most delicate life. You have a steady physical energy that
                        demands the creation of safe spaces. You are here to learn that <strong>to nurture another is to
                            nurture the divine</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as approachable, gentle, and deeply reliable. You have a "soft
                        power" that makes people feel safe in your presence. You don't enjoy conflict and will often
                        find yourself in the role of the "peacemaker" or the "supporter." You have a natural sense of
                        "flow"—you know how to make things beautiful and comfortable without being showy. You are likely
                        a person of profound loyalty; if you commit to a person or a cause, you are there for the long
                        haul. People find you "lucky" in your relationships, but your success is actually a reflection
                        of your ability to listen with your heart and your refusal to let go of what you value.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to extreme bouts of moodiness and a "passive-aggressive"
                            complex</strong>. Because you focus so much on harmony, you may bury your own needs until
                        they erupt in subtle ways. You are the "Individual" who expects the world to feel what you feel
                        without you having to say it. Your persona is that of the "Enlightened Caretaker"—someone who
                        leads through the power of their empathy and their commitment to the well-being of the group.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a May 2nd person is a search for a "Soul-Mirror." You are not interested in the "social
                        game" of dating. You seek a "Deep Union"—someone who can handle your need for closeness and who
                        respects your need for physical and emotional security. You need a partner who is your equal in
                        loyalty and depth. You are incredibly nurturing and sensual, providing a life of tactile beauty
                        and emotional stability for those you care about, but you also require <strong>absolute loyalty
                            and regular reassurance</strong>.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the source of warmth and the architect of shared peace. However, you
                        can be <strong>emotionally demanding in your need for total transparency</strong>. You cannot
                        tolerate a partner who is cold, dismissive, or who tries to manipulate your sensitivity. You are
                        best suited for fellow Earth signs (Virgo, Capricorn) who share your practical drive, or Water
                        signs (Scorpio, Pisces) who share your depth and emotional intensity. Fire signs might provide
                        the spark you love, but they may find your need for routine "too heavy," while Air signs might
                        find your emotional depth "overwhelming."</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>healing, the arts, counseling, or design</strong>.
                        Many born on this day become high-profile therapists, successful interior designers, influential
                        educators, or strategic leaders in the non-profit world. You are a natural at spotting
                        "emotional lack" in an environment and knowing exactly how to fill it. You are best when you are
                        in a position where you can work with people directly or when you are the "authority" who
                        provides the aesthetic direction for a space or a community.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to experience success through <strong>originality and smart, steady
                            planning</strong>. You aren't a traditional gambler; you are an investor in "comfort." You
                        view money as <strong>peace, security, and a tool for creating a beautiful life for your loved
                            ones</strong>. You are the one who will naturally invest in a home, fine art, and
                        high-quality assets. Your challenge is to ensure that your "sensitivity" doesn't lead to a total
                        neglect of your independent financial foundation. You are most successful when your "work"
                        allows for human connection and the opportunity to share your unique aesthetic sense.</p>

                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>mental state and your sense of domestic
                            peace</strong>. Because you feel so much and take in so much data from your environment, you
                        are prone to "emotional burnout"—physical exhaustion that manifests as throat issues, digestive
                        sensitivity, or chronic fatigue. You need to learn the art of <strong>intentional
                            grounding</strong>. Taurus rules the throat and neck, while the Number 2 rules the stomach
                        and the fluids. You need regular, steady physical activity that feels like "meditation in
                        motion"—think long-distance walking, swimming, or rhythmic cycling.</p>

                    <p>Mentally, you can suffer from <strong>"discord fatigue."</strong> If your home or work life is
                        loud or chaotic, your health will suffer. Learning the art of <strong>setting
                            boundaries</strong>—without losing your heart—is your most powerful health practice. You are
                        here to learn that <strong>the body is the sacred temple of the feeling mind</strong>. Regular
                        "digital detoxes" and time by the water are essential.</p>

                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>dependency and a refusal to "stand alone."</strong> Because you
                        value union so much, you may stay in toxic situations or suppress your own light for the sake of
                        the pair. You may also struggle with a "victim" complex, believing that you are the only one who
                        cares. Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Self-Sovereignty</strong>. Realizing that your
                        power is most effective when it is rooted in your own internal stability, and that you are whole
                        on your own, is your key to joy.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>it is okay to say "no."</strong> You often feel that you
                        must be the "support" for everyone. Finding peace in your own independent needs is where your
                        true spiritual growth happens. When you find your internal silence, you realize that you are
                        never truly alone.</p>

                        Synthesis & Higher Purpose</h2>
                    <p>The May 2nd person is the <strong>Messenger of the Heart's Stability</strong>. You are the one
                        who has the eyes to see the beauty and the heart to protect it. You are here to <strong>Grace
                            the World with Compassion</strong>. Your higher purpose is to provide a template of human
                        emotional potential—to show what can happen when a disciplined spirit, a sharp mind, and a deep
                        heart join forces to create peace. When you lead with your heart and focus on the empowerment of
                        others, you are truly a force for miracles.</p>

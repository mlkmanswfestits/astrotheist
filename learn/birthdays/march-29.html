                        Cosmic Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>Born on March 29th, you are an Aries who embody the principle of <strong>intuitive leadership and
                            emotional complexity</strong>. You inhabit the <strong>first decante</strong> of Aries,
                        ruled by <strong>Mars</strong>, which grants you a raw, primordial drive and an unapologetic
                        sense of self. However, the influence of the <strong>Number 29</strong> vibration (2+9=11=2)
                        creates a truly complex and mystical alchemical mix. You aren't just here to fight; you are here
                        to perceive. You have a "visionary-healer" soul that seeking to find the sacred in the insight.
                        You are the "Channel of the Spark."</p>

                    <p>You possess a highly receptive mind and a refusal to ignore the subtle undercurrents of reality.
                        You have an "innovator-healer" dynamic: you see the new horizon (Aries), and you have the
                        intuitive drive (Number 11/2/29 Resonance) to stabilize and support those energies. You aren't
                        interested in purely material success; you are interested in the <strong>triumph of spiritual
                            truth over emotional limitation</strong>. You have a natural sense of "premonition," knowing
                        exactly where the next shift will occur. You are here to learn that <strong>your unique
                            sensitivity is a form of spiritual mastery</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">II.
                        Planetary & Elemental Influence</h2>
                    <p>Your primary ruler is <strong>Mars</strong>, the planet of action, desire, and the warrior
                        spirit. This gives you your trademark courage, your physical vitality, and your
                        "first-responder" instinct in all situations. However, the influence of the <strong>Number
                            11</strong> creates a resonance with <strong>Neptune</strong> (the planet of higher vision)
                        and the <strong>Moon</strong> (the planet of emotion). Mars brings the steel, while Neptune and
                        the Moon bring the mystery and the pulse. You are a "Radiant Nurturer"—someone who can
                        intuitiveley sense the need for a fresh start and has the emotional confidence to lead others.
                        You have an "illuminated" soul that seeking to find the sacred in the connection.</p>

                    <p>Your element, <strong>Fire</strong>, is in its most "radiant and internal" state. This isn't a
                        wildfire; it is <strong>the flickering light of the spiritual lamp</strong>—steady, protective,
                        and always centered on a higher purpose. You have an emotional energy that demands integrity and
                        shared insight. You are here to learn that <strong>your brilliance is a form of spiritual
                            service</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">III.
                        Performance & The Persona</h2>
                    <p>In public, you are often seen as charismatic, dignified, and highly intelligent. You have a
                        "natural authority" that comes from your obvious depth rather than a need for dominance. You
                        don't enjoy being a follower and will often be the one to challenge a convention or a stale
                        tradition. You have a natural sense of "authenticity"—you don't know how to be anyone but
                        yourself. You are likely a person of profound technical or leadership talent; you have a way of
                        making the complex look solid and trustworthy. People find you "inspiring" because you possess
                        both the hearts to feel and the guts to stand alone.</p>

                    <p>However, you can also be <strong>prone to bouts of hypersensitivity and "emotional
                            withdrawal."</strong> Because you are a "Number 11 resonance," you may carry a subconscious
                        fear of being "over-stimulated" by others, leading you to push your independence too far. Your
                        challenge is "emotional stability"—the tendency to close your heart when the world feels too
                        harsh or illogical. Your persona is that of the "Enlightened Outsider"—someone who uses
                        individual brilliance to serve the whole through vision.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">IV. Love
                        & Relationship Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>Love for a March 29th person is a search for "Soul-Union." You are not interested in a partner
                        who is shallow or purely transactional. You seek a "Spirit-Partner"—someone who can meet your
                        intensity and who is equally committed to building a life centered on truth and mutual
                        recognition. You are incredibly romantic and highly devoted, often being the one who initiates
                        the most profound emotional breakthroughs. You need a partner who is <strong>confident,
                            appreciative, and emotionally expressive</strong>.</p>

                    <p>In a relationship, you are the source of emotional fire and the keeper of the shared potential.
                        However, you can be <strong>emotionally vulnerable to "unrequited recognition."</strong> You may
                        feel resentful if you feel your efforts are being ignored. You cannot tolerate a partner who is
                        dismissive or who tries to dim your light. You are best suited for fellow Fire signs (Leo,
                        Sagittarius) who understand your drive, or Air signs (Gemini, Aquarius) who can provide the
                        intellectual "oxygen" for your fire. Earth signs might share your need for manifestation, but
                        Water signs might feel too "heavy" for your radiant soul.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">V.
                        Career, Success & Finances</h2>
                    <p>You thrive in careers that involve <strong>leadership, the arts, counseling, or spiritual
                            advocacy</strong>. Many born on this day become successful writers, designers, therapists,
                        or entertainers. You are a natural at "creating value through vision." You are best when you are
                        in a position where you can use your intuition and your solar confidence to lead a team toward a
                        significant goal.</p>

                    <p>Financially, you are likely to experience success through your drive and your ability to spot
                        trends before they become mainstream. You view money as <strong>energy for impact and a means to
                            support your independence</strong>. You are the one who will naturally invest in projects
                        that align with your personal vision. Your challenge is to ensure that your "pursuit of the new"
                        doesn't lead to financial instability. You are most successful when your "work" allows you to be
                        an authentic authority in your field.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VI.
                        Health & Vitality</h2>
                    <p>Your health is directly tied to your <strong>emotional environment and your nervous
                            system</strong> (Number 11 resonance). Because you carry so much inner pressure, you are
                        prone to headaches, insomnia, and "burnout from over-thinking." You need to learn the art of
                        <strong>energetic release</strong>. Quiet physical activity—like yoga, swimming, or long walks
                        in nature—is not a luxury for you; it is essential for your health.</p>

                    <p>Physically, you should watch your adrenal health and your sleep patterns. Regular physical
                        activity and a diet that supports the brain are the best ways to keep your system in balance.
                        You are here to learn that <strong>your vitality is born from your authenticity</strong>.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: var(--gold-primary); font-family: var(--font-heading); margin-top: 3rem;">VII.
                        Hidden Challenges & Karmic Lessons</h2>
                    <p>Your greatest shadow is <strong>hypersensitivity and a fear of "the ordinary heart."</strong> You
                        may try to distance yourself from others because you feel they don't share your level of
                        insight. You may also struggle with an "independent-self" that refuses to ask for help because
                        you view vulnerability as failure. Your karmic lesson is to learn <strong>Humility and
                            Inclusion</strong>. Realizing that the most profound victories are found through connection,
                        not just will, is your key to true peace.</p>

                    <p>You are also here to learn that <strong>it is okay for things to be messy.</strong> You often
                        view logic as your only safety. Finding peace in the "mysterious and the un-explained" allows

            If the Ascendant is "I," the Descendant is "You." It marks the point where the sky meets the earth in the
            west—the place where the sun sets. It represents the gateway to relationship, marriage, open enemies, and
            the qualities we disown in ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Descendant (DC) is the cusp of the 7th House. It stands directly opposite the Ascendant. Together, they
            form the <strong>Axis of Relationship</strong>. We identify consciously with our Ascendant ("I am
            impulsive," says the Aries Rising), but we project the qualities of our Descendant onto others ("Why is my
            partner so indecisive?" they ask of their Libra Descendant).
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Technical Definition</h3>
            <p>
                The Descendant is the point where the ecliptic intersects the western horizon at the moment of birth. It
                is always exactly 180 degrees opposite the Ascendant. If you know your Rising Sign, you automatically
                know your Descendant sign.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. The Mirror of the Self</h2>
        <p>
            Psychologically, the Descendant is the <strong>Shadow</strong>. Not necessarily in a negative sense, but in
            the sense that it is unconscious. It contains the traits we do not recognize in ourselves, so we seek them
            in others to become whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why we say "opposites attract." We attract our Descendant because we crave balance.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ascendant:</strong> Shows how you act when you are independent.</li>
            <li><strong>Descendant:</strong> Shows what you need from a partner to feel complete.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Marriage and Business Partners</h2>
        <p>
            The 7th House rules all committed one-on-one relationships. This includes marriage, long-term cohabitation,
            and business contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sign on the Descendant describes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The "Type" of person you commit to:</strong> Not just who you date for fun (5th House), but who
                you marry.</li>
            <li><strong>The dynamic of the relationship:</strong> Is it fiery and competitive? Stable and boring?
                Intellectual and distant?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. "Open Enemies"</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional astrology calls the 7th House the house of "Open Enemies." The 12th House rules "Hidden Enemies"
            (secret saboteurs), but the 7th House rules enemies you can see—opposing counsel in court, a competitor in
            business, or an ex-spouse in a divorce.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why? Because an enemy is just a partner in conflict. It is a one-on-one relationship defined by opposition.
            The person who hates you often mirrors your Descendant just as much as the person who loves you.
        </p>

        <h2>4. The Descendant Through the Signs</h2>

        <h3>Aries Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Libra Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is bold, decisive, and even a bit aggressive. You are
            so diplomatic and compromising that you need someone to fight your battles or push you into action.
            <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting angry or selfish partners because you refuse to own your own anger.</p>

        <h3>Taurus Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Scorpio Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is stable, calm, and simple. You are intense and
            complicated (Scorpio), so you need a rock. You crave loyalty and sensual comfort. <strong>Trap:</strong>
            Attracting stubborn or materialistic partners because you secretly crave simplicity but create chaos.</p>

        <h3>Gemini Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Sagittarius Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is witty, intelligent, and chatty. You are all
            about the big picture and philosophy (Sagittarius), so you need someone to handle the details and keep the
            conversation flowing. <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting unreliable or superficial partners.</p>

        <h3>Cancer Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Capricorn Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is nurturing, soft, and emotional. You present a
            tough, competent exterior (Capricorn), but secretly crave to be babied. You need a safe harbor.
            <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting needy or moody partners because you suppress your own emotional needs.</p>

        <h3>Leo Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Aquarius Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is warm, expressive, and a bit of a star. You are
            cool and detached (Aquarius), so you are drawn to the warmth and drama of Leo. You need someone to light up
            the room. <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting narcissists because you refuse to take center stage yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>Virgo Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Pisces Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is organized, practical, and grounded. You are a
            dreamer (Pisces) and often disorganized, so you need someone to handle the bills and the details.
            <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting critical or nagging partners because you refuse to be practical.</p>

        <h3>Libra Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Aries Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is charming, beautiful, and diplomatic. You are rough
            and ready (Aries), so you need someone to smooth your feathers. You crave peace and partnership.
            <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting passive-aggressive or indecisive partners because you are too dominant.
        </p>

        <h3>Scorpio Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Taurus Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is intense, deep, and transformative. You are steady
            and calm (Taurus), but secretly bored by it. You crave emotional depth and sexual intensity.
            <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting manipulative or dangerous partners because you repress your own dark side.
        </p>

        <h3>Sagittarius Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Gemini Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is adventurous, wise, and free. You are full of
            questions (Gemini), and you want someone who has the answers—a guide or guru. You need travel and freedom in
            love. <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting non-committal or preachy partners.</p>

        <h3>Capricorn Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Cancer Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is responsible, successful, and mature. You are
            emotional and nurturing (Cancer), and you want someone to provide structure and security.
            <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting cold or controlling partners ("Daddy issues") because you want to be taken
            care of.</p>

        <h3>Aquarius Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Leo Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is unique, intelligent, and independent. You are the
            star (Leo), but you need an audience who is cool enough to not compete with you, yet interesting enough to
            keep you engaged. You need friendship first. <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting emotionally unavailable
            partners.</p>

        <h3>Pisces Descendant</h3>
        <p><strong>(Virgo Rising).</strong> You seek a partner who is spiritual, artistic, and compassionate. You are so
            focused on the mundane details (Virgo) that you crave the escape and magic that a Pisces partner provides.
            <strong>Trap:</strong> Attracting addicts or victims ("fixer-uppers") because you want to save someone.</p>

        <h2>5. Integration</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of astrology is integration. To have a healthy relationship, you must learn to embody the positive
            traits of your Descendant yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a Libra Rising, don't just wait for an Aries to come save you—learn to be brave (Aries) yourself.
            Then you will attract an Aries who is a partner, not a savior.

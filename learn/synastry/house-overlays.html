    <div class="astro-container py-5">
        <h1 class="hero-title text-center pt-5">House Overlays</h1>
        <p class="lead text-center">Where your planets light up their life areas.</p>

        <div class="house-grid">
            <a href="houses/1st.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">1st</span>
                <h3>The House of Self</h3>
                <p>When someone's planets fall in your 1st house, there is an immediate, visceral impact. You feel their
                    energy physically. This overlay creates <strong>instant recognition</strong>. If their Sun is here,
                    they "shine" directly on you, making you feel seen and energized. If their Saturn is here, you
                    might feel judged or restricted by their presence. The Planet person is often very focused on the
                    House person's appearance and personality.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/2nd.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">2nd</span>
                <h3>The House of Values</h3>
                <p>This overlay shifts the focus to <strong>security, money, and self-worth</strong>. It is common in
                    long-term marriages where shared resources are key. The House person may feel that the Planet
                    person is a "resource" or brings stability. Conversely, if Mars is here, they might argue about
                    spending. It’s a very grounded, practical connection that determines if you can actually build a
                    life together.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/3rd.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">3rd</span>
                <h3>The House of Communication</h3>
                <p>The "Best Friend" overlay. Planets here stimulate <strong>intellectual curiosity and
                        conversation</strong>. You likely share similar hobbies or ways of thinking. The House person
                    finds the Planet person easy to talk to and may feel like they are "siblings" in spirit. Great
                    for mental rapport and keeping the relationship interesting through dialogue and short trips.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/4th.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">4th</span>
                <h3>The House of Home</h3>
                <p>A deep, <strong>psychological and domestic bond</strong>. You feel like family almost instantly.
                    This is the "living together" overlay. The House person feels a sense of safety and "at-home-ness"
                    with the Planet person. However, since the 4th house represents our roots and childhood, this
                    overlay can also trigger old family dynamics and early-life patterns that need healing.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/5th.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">5th</span>
                <h3>The House of Pleasure</h3>
                <p>The "Romance and Dating" overlay. This creates <strong>playfulness, creativity, and sexual
                        chemistry</strong>. The House person sees the Planet person as someone they can have fun
                    with. If your partner's Sun or Venus falls in your 5th, you likely find them incredibly attractive
                    and enjoyable to be around. It is the signature of the "honeymoon phase" and shared joy.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/6th.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">6th</span>
                <h3>The House of Service</h3>
                <p>The "Daily Grind" overlay. This is about <strong>routines, work, and health</strong>. It might not
                    sound romantic, but it’s essential for functional relationships. The Planet person helps the House
                    person with their chores or health habits. If poorly aspected, the House person can feel like a
                    "servant" to the Planet person, or that the Planet person is too critical of their lifestyle.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/7th.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">7th</span>
                <h3>The House of Partnership</h3>
                <p>The classic indicator for <strong>one-on-one commitment and marriage</strong>. The House person
                    views the Planet person as the ideal "Significant Other." There is a natural pull toward
                    cooperation and legally binding unions. You "fit" together in the way a traditional partnership
                    requires. The Planet person feels a strong urge to partner up with the House person specifically.
                </p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/8th.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">8th</span>
                <h3>The House of Intimacy</h3>
                <p>Intense, <strong>transformative, and soul-merging</strong>. This house governs shared finances, sex,
                    and deep psychological work. When planets fall here, the relationship is rarely "casual." You
                    trigger each other's deepest fears and desires. The House person may feel "possessed" or
                    profoundly changed by the Planet person. A very magnetic but potentially volatile connection.
                </p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/9th.html" class="house-card" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">9th</span>
                <h3>The House of Wisdom</h3>
                <p>The "Teacher and Explorer" overlay. Planets here encourage <strong>growth, travel, and
                        philosophy</strong>. The House person views the Planet person as an inspiration or a guide.
                    You likely enjoy traveling together or debating big life questions. It’s a relationship that
                    expands your horizons and helps you see the "big picture" of your life path.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/10th.html" class="house-card"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">10th</span>
                <h3>The House of Status</h3>
                <p>The "Power Couple" overlay. This is about <strong>public image, career, and reputation</strong>.
                    The Planet person often helps the House person achieve their goals or status. The House person
                    respects the Planet person and may see them as an authority figure. It is an excellent overlay
                    for business partners or couples who want to build a public legacy together.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/11th.html" class="house-card"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">11th</span>
                <h3>The House of Community</h3>
                <p>The "Friendship and Hopes" overlay. This creates a <strong>shared vision for the future</strong>.
                    You likely share the same social circles and long-term goals. The House person feels like the
                    Planet person is "on their team" and supports their dreams. It’s a socially-oriented connection
                    that keeps the relationship from becoming too insular.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="houses/12th.html" class="house-card"
                style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block;">
                <span class="house-number">12th</span>
                <h3>The House of the Unconscious</h3>
                <p>The "Deep Psychic" overlay. This involves <strong>unspoken bonds, secrets, and spiritual
                        dissolution</strong>. The House person may feel that the Planet person can "see" their
                    hidden parts. It can be incredibly romantic and ethereal, or it can feel elusive and confusing.
                    There is often a sense of "karmic debt" or a mission to heal each other in ways that are hard to
                    put into words.</p>
